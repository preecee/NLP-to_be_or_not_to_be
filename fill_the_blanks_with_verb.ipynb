      "eagerly his eyes followed the movements of the canoes daringly poised in the stre ----  just below the tossing, foaming, white water.\n",
      "it  ----  the first day of the spring fishing, and more exciting sport than this indian white-fishing hugh beaupré had never seen.\n",
      "three canoes were engaged in the fascinating g ---- e, two indians in each.\n",
      "one knelt in the stern with h ----  paddle.\n",
      "the other stood erect in the bow, a slender pole fully ten feet long in h ----  hands, balancing with extraordinary skill as the frail craft pitched about in the racing current.\n",
      "the standing indian in the ne ---- st canoe was a fine figure of a young man, in close-fitting buckskin leggings, his slender, muscular, bronze body stripped to the waist.\n",
      "above his black head, bent a little as he gazed intently down into the clear water, gulls wheeled and scre ---- ed in anger at the invasion of their fishing ground.\n",
      "suddenly the fisherman pointed, with a swift movement of his left hand, to the spot where his keen eyes had caught the gle ----  of a fin.\n",
      "instantly h ----  companion responded to the signal.\n",
      "with a quick dig and tw ---- t of the paddle blade, he shot the canoe forward at an angle.\n",
      "a dexterous flirt of the net, and the fish, its wet, silvery sides gle ---- ing in the sun, landed in the bottom of the boat.\n",
      "the lad on the bank had been holding h ----  breath.\n",
      "now his tense watchfulness relaxed, and he glanced farther up-stre ----  at the white water boiling over and around the black rocks.\n",
      "a gle ----  of bright red among the bushes along the shore caught his eye.\n",
      "the tip of a scarlet cap, then a head, appeared above the budding alders, as a man c ---- e, with swift, swinging strides, along the shore path.\n",
      "“holá, hugh beaupré,” he cried, when he  ----  close enough to be heard above the tumult of the rapids.\n",
      "“m’sieu cadotte, he want you.” the lad scr ---- bled to his feet.\n",
      "“monsieur cadotte sent you for me?” he asked in surpr ---- e.\n",
      "“what does he want with me, bapt ---- te?” “a messenger from the new fort has come, but a few moments ago,” baptiste replied, this time in french.\n",
      "hugh, half french himself, understood that language well, though he spoke it less fluently than engl ---- h.\n",
      "“from the k ---- inistikwia?\n",
      "he has brought news of my father?” “that m’sieu did not tell me, but yes, i think it may  ----  so, since m’sieu sends for you.” hugh had scarcely waited for an answer.\n",
      "before baptiste had finished his speech, the boy  ----  running along the river path.\n",
      "the french canadian strode after, the tassel of his cap bobbing, the ends of his scarlet sash stre ---- ing in the brisk breeze.\n",
      "monsieur cadotte was alone, going through for a second time the reports and letters the half-breed messenger had brought from the company’s headquarters on the river k ---- inistikwia at the farther end of lake superior.\n",
      "“from my father?” c ---- e the eager question.\n",
      "on the outer wrapping the n ---- e “hugh beaupré” was written in a brownish fluid.\n",
      "his first glance at the thin squ ---- s of white, papery bark showed him that the writing was not his father’s.\n",
      "the letter was in french, in the s ---- e muddy brown ink as the address.\n",
      "the handwriting  ----  good, better than the elder beaupré’s, and the spelling not so bad as hugh’s own when he attempted to write french.\n",
      "“my brother,” the letter  ---- gan, “our father, before he died, bade me write to you at the sault de ste.\n",
      "but wind and rain c ---- e and the white fog.\n",

      "thy half-brother, bla ---- e beaupré or attekonse, little caribou.” hugh read the strange letter to the end, then turned back to the first bark sheet to read again.\n",
      "he had reached the last page a second time when cadotte’s voice aroused him from h ----  absorption.\n",
      "“it  ----  bad news?” the trader asked.\n",
      "“yes,” hugh ans ---- d, raising his eyes from the letter.\n",
      "“my father is dead.” “bad news in truth.” cadotte’s voice  ----  vibrant with sympathy.\n",
      "“it was not, i hope, _la petite vérole_?” his despatches had informed him that the dreaded smallpox had broken out  ---- ong the indian villages west of superior.\n",
      "“no, he  ----  wrecked.” hugh hesitated, then continued, “on his spring trip down his boat went on the rocks, and he was so sorely hurt that he lived but a short time.” “a sad accident truly.\n",
      " ---- lieve me, i feel for you, my boy.\n",
      "if there  ----  anything i can do——” cadotte broke off, then added, “you will wish to return to your relatives.\n",
      "from there you can readily find a way of return to montreal.” hugh  ----  at a loss for a reply.\n",
      "he must obey h ----  half-brother’s summons and go to recover the furs and the packet that made up the lads’ joint inheritance.\n",
      "kind though cadotte had been, hugh d ---- d not tell him all.\n",
      "“he bade us keep silence,” little caribou had written, and one word in the letter d ---- closed to hugh a good reason for silence.\n",
      "jean beaupré had been a free trader and trapper, doing business with the indians on h ----  own account, not in the direct service of any company.\n",
      "hugh knew, however, that h ----  father had been in the habit of buying his supplies from and selling his pelts to the old northwest company.\n",
      "very likely he had  ----  under some contract to do so.\n",
      "yet in these last instructions to h ----  sons, he bade them take the furs to the _new_ northwest company, a secession from and rival to the old organization.\n",
      "he must have had some d ---- agreement, an actual quarrel perhaps, with the old company.\n",
      "the rivalry between the fur companies  ----  hot and bitter.\n",
      "hugh  ----  very sure that if monsieur cadotte learned of the hidden pelts, he would inform his superiors.\n",
      "certainly, if he even suspected that the pelts  ----  destined for the new company, cadotte would do nothing to further and everything to hinder hugh’s project.\n",

      "he had to make up h ----  mind quickly.\n",
      "cadotte  ----  eying him sharply and curiously.\n",
      "“th ----  letter is from my half-brother.” he paused in embarrassment.\n",
      "the trader knew that jean  ---- aupré had an indian wife, and supposed that hugh had known it also.\n",
      "part indian himself, cadotte could never have understood the lad’s  ---- azement and consternation at learning now, for the first time, of his half-brother.\n",
      "“my father,” hugh went on, “bade blaise, my half-brother, tell me to—come to the k ---- inistikwia and meet blaise there.\n",
      "he wished me to—to make my brother’s acquaintance and—and receive from him—something my father left me,” he concluded l ---- ely.\n",

      "early the next morning bapt ---- te and hugh embarked above the rapids in baptiste’s small birch canoe.\n",
      "the distance to point aux pins  ----  short, but paddling, even in the more sluggish channels, against the current of the st. mary’s river in spring flood was strenuous work, as hugh, wielding the bow blade, soon discovered.\n",
      "signs of spring  ----  everywhere.\n",
      "the snow was gone, and flocks of small, migrating birds were flitting and twittering  ---- ong the trees and now and then bursting into snatches of song.\n",
      "the leaves of birches, willows and alders were beginning to unfold, the shores showing a faint mist of pale green, though here and there in the quiet backwaters  ---- ong rocks and on the north sides of islands, ice still remained.\n",
      "at point aux pins, or pine point,  ----  the northwest company’s shipyard.\n",
      "in a safe and well sheltered harbor, formed by the long point that ran out into the river, the sailing vessels belonging to the company  ----  built and repaired.\n",
      "the sloop _otter_, which had spent the winter there,  ----  now anchored a little way out from shore.\n",

      "tents and rude cabins on the sandy ground  ---- ong scrubby jack pines and willows housed the workers, and near by, waiting for the fish cleanings and other refuse to be thrown out, a flock of gulls, gray-winged, with gleaming white heads and necks, rode the water like a fleet of little boats.\n",
      "as the canoe approached, the birds, with a splashing and beating of wings, rose, whirled about in the air, and alighted again farther out, each, as it struck the water, po ---- ing for a moment with black-tipped wings raised and half spread.\n",
      "on a stretch of sand beyond the shipyard, bapt ---- te and hugh landed, stepping out, one on each side, the moment the canoe touched, lifting it from the water and carrying it ashore.\n",
      "captain bennett  ----  personally superintending the work on his ship.\n",
      "to him baptiste, who had been previously engaged as one of the small crew, made known hugh’s wish to sail to the k ---- inistikwia.\n",

      "every tree and shrub, its summer foliage still in the bud,  ----  wet, snow covered or ice coated.\n",
      "bapt ---- te, skilled in the art of starting a blaze under the most adverse conditions, soon had a roaring fire.\n",
      "by that time the snow had entirely ceased, and the clouds  ----  breaking.\n",
      "the broken arm was reset, the minor injuries c ---- d for, and a pole and bark shelter, with one side open to the fire, was set up.\n",

      "but the sheltered harbor  ----  a welcome haven to the sorely battered ship and the exhausted sailors.\n",
      "wolves howled not far from the c ---- p that night, and next morning their tracks were found in the snow on the beach close to where the sloop lay.\n",
      "it would have required far fiercer enemies than the slinking, cowardly, brush wolves to d ---- turb the rest of the tired crew of the _otter_.\n",
      "hugh did not even hear the  ---- asts.\n",

      "the water  ----  pumped out, most of the cargo piled on the beach, and the sloop hauled farther up by means of a rudely constructed windlass.\n",
      "then the strained se ---- s were calked and a few new boards put in.\n",
      "a tall, straight spruce  ----  felled and trimmed to replace the broken mast, and a small mainsail devised from extra canvas.\n",
      "during that time the weather was bright, and, except in the deeply shaded places, the snow and ice disappe ---- d rapidly.\n",
      "from the very slight current in the water, captain bennett concluded that the place where he had taken refuge  ----  a real bay, not a river mouth.\n",
      "he had not yet discovered whether he  ----  on the mainland or an island.\n",
      "the repairs to his ship  ----  of the first importance, and he postponed determining his whereabouts until the _otter_ was made seaworthy once more.\n",
      "not a trace of human beings had  ----  found.\n",
      "the boldness of the wolves and lynxes, that c ---- e close to the camp every night, indicated that no one, red or white, was in the habit of visiting this lonely spot.\n",
      "on the third day the sloop  ----  launched, anchored a little way from shore and rigged.\n",
      "while the reloading  ----  going on, under the eyes of the mate, the captain, with baptiste and hugh at the oars, set out in the small boat for the harbor mouth.\n",
      "the shore along which they rowed  ---- , at first, wooded to the water line.\n",
      "as they went farther out and the bay widened, the land they  ----  skirting rose more steeply, edged with sheer rocks, cliffs and great boulders.\n",
      "from time to time captain bennett glanced up at the abrupt rocks and forested ridges on h ----  right, or across to the lower land on the other side of the bay.\n",
      "directly ahead, some miles across the open lake, he could see a d ---- tant, detached bit of land, an island undoubtedly.\n",
      "most of the time, however, his eyes  ----  on the water.\n",
      "he  ----  endeavoring to locate the treacherous reefs and shallows he must avoid when he took his ship out of her safe harbor.\n",
      "an excl ---- ation from baptiste, who had turned his head to look to the west and north, recalled the captain from his study of the unfamiliar waters.\n",

      "“it is thunder cape,” the captain replied, overlooking the breach of discipline, “the eastern boundary of thunder bay, where the k ---- inistikwia empties and the new fort is situated.” “truly it must be the cap au tonnerre, the giant that sleeps,” baptiste agreed, resting on his oars to study the long shape, like a gigantic figure stretched out at rest upon the water.\n",
      "“the others to the north  ----  the cape at the nipigon and the island of st. ignace.” “we are not as far off our course as i feared,” remarked the captain with satisfaction.\n",

      "i have seen one end or the other of royale many times from a distance, when crossing to the k ---- inistikwia or to the grand portage, but i never set foot on the island before.” again he glanced up at the steep rocks and thick woods on his right, then his eyes sought the heaving blue of the open lake.\n",
      "“th ----  northwest breeze would be almost dead against us, and it is increasing.\n",
      "by that time i think we shall have a change of wind.” their purpose accomplished, the oarsmen turned the boat and started back towards c ---- p.\n",
      "they were skirting a rock cliff, sheer from the lake, its brown-gray surface stained almost black at the water line, blotched farther up with lichens, black, orange and green-gray, and worn and se ---- ed and rent with vertical cracks from top to bottom.\n",

      "the wreck  ----  quite empty, not an oar or a fragment of mast or canvas remaining.\n",
      "the old boat had one marked peculiarity which could  ----  seen even in the dim light of the crack.\n",
      "the thwart that bore the hole where the mast had stood  ----  painted bright red, the paint being evidently a mixture of vermilion and grease.\n",
      "it  ----  but little faded by water and weather, and on the red background had been drawn, in some black pigment, figures such as the indians used in their picture writing.\n",
      "hugh had seen birch canoes fancifully decorated about prow and stern, and he asked baptiste if such paintings  ----  customary on the heavier wooden boats as well.\n",
      "“on the outside sometimes they have figures in color, yes,” was the reply, “but never have i seen one painted in this way.” “i wonder what bec ---- e of the men who were in her when she was driven on these rocks.” baptiste shook his head.\n",

      "there is nothing in her, though she  ----  right side up when she was driven in here by the waves.\n",
      "and here, in th ----  lonely place, there has been no one to plunder her.” “do no indians live on this big island?” queried hugh.\n",

      "no doubt the fort, with all its busy activity in its wilderness surroundings,  ----  worth seeing, but he did not choose to visit the place for fear someone might ask his business there.\n",
      "he was keenly aw ----  that his business was likely to be, not with the old northwest company, but with its rival, the new northwest company, sometimes called in derision the x y company.\n",
      "in a quandary where to look for h ----  unknown brother, he wandered about aimlessly for a time, avoiding rather than seeking companionship.\n",
      "the ground about the new fort was low and sw ---- py, with thick woods of evergreens, birch and poplar wherever the land had not been cleared for building or burned over through carelessness.\n",
      "away from the river bank and the fort, the place  ----  not cheerful or encouraging to a lonely boy on that chill spring day.\n",
      "the sky was gray and lowering, the wind cold, the distance shrouded in fog, the air heavy with the earthy smell of d ---- p, spongy soil and sodden, last year’s leaves.\n",
      "hugh had looked forward with eager anticipation to his arrival at the k ---- inistikwia, but now all things seemed to combine to make him low spirited and lonely.\n",

      "“not following.” the swift smile so like, yet unlike, that of jean  ---- aupré, crossed the boy’s face again.\n",
      "it  ----  not difficult, since you thought not that anyone watched.\n",
      "then we will talk together, my brother.” passing hugh, bla ---- e took the lead, going along the forest trail with a lithe swiftness that spurred the older lad to his fastest walking pace.\n",
      "after perhaps half a mile, they c ---- e to the top of a low knoll where an opening had been made by the fall of a big spruce.\n",
      "blaise seated himself on the prostrate trunk, and hugh dropped down beside him, more eager than he c ---- d to betray to hear his indian brother’s story.\n",
      "jean  ---- aupré had spent the previous winter trading and trapping in the country south of the lake of the woods, now included in the state of minnesota.\n",
      "bla ---- e and his mother had remained at wauswaugoning bay, north of the grand portage.\n",
      "just at dusk of a night late in march, beaupré staggered into their c ---- p, his face ghastly, his clothes blood stained, mind and body in the last stages of exhaustion.\n",
      "it  ----  some time before his squaw and his son succeeded in bringing him back to consciousness.\n",
      "in spite of his weakness he  ----  determined to tell his story.\n",
      "mustering all h ----  failing strength, he commenced.\n",
      " ---- fore the snow had begun to melt under the spring sun, he had started, he told them, with one indian companion and two dog sleds loaded with pelts, for lake superior.\n",
      "travelling along the frozen stre ---- s and lakes, he reached the trading post at the fond du lac on the st. louis river.\n",
      "while he was there, a spell of unusually warm early spring weather cle ---- d the river mouth.\n",
      "the winter had  ----  mild, with little ice in that part of the lake.\n",
      "at fond du lac  ---- aupré obtained a bateau, as the canadians called their wooden boats, and rigged it with mast and sail.\n",
      "he and h ----  companion put their furs aboard, and started up the northwest shore of lake superior.\n",
      "thus far he succeeded in telling h ----  story clearly enough, then, worn out with the effort, he lapsed into unconsciousness.\n",
      "twice he rallied and tried to go on, but his speech  ----  vague and disconnected.\n",
      "as well as he could, bla ---- e pieced together the fragments of the story.\n",
      "somewhere between the fond du lac and the grand portage the bateau had  ----  wrecked in a storm.\n",
      "when he reached this part of his tale, jean beaupré bec ---- e much agitated.\n",
      "he gasped out again and again that he had hidden the furs and the “packet” in a safe cache, and that bla ---- e and his other son hugh must go get them.\n",
      "he called the furs his sons’ inheritance, for he was clearly aw ----  that he could not live.\n",
      "the pelts were a very good season’s catch, and the boys must take them to the new northwest company’s post at the k ---- inistikwia.\n",
      "but it  ----  the packet about which he seemed most anxious.\n",
      "hugh must carry the packet to montreal to monsieur dubo ---- .\n",
      "blaise asked where his brother  ----  to be found, and received instructions to go or send to the sault.\n",
      " ---- fore the lad learned definitely where to look for the furs and the packet, jean beaupré lapsed once more into unconsciousness.\n",
      "he rallied only long enough for the min ---- trations of a priest, who happened to be at the grand portage on a missionary journey.\n",
      "though hugh had scarcely known his father, he  ----  much moved at the story of his death.\n",
      "he felt a curious mixture of sympathy for and jealousy of h ----  indian half-brother, when he saw, in spite of the latter’s controlled and quiet manner, how strongly he felt his loss.\n",
      "hugh respected the depth of the boy’s sorrow, yet he could not but feel as if he, the elder son, had  ----  unrightfully defrauded.\n",
      "the half-breed lad had known their common father so much  ---- tter than he, the wholly white son.\n",
      "for some minutes after bla ---- e ceased speaking, hugh sat silent, oppressed by conflicting thoughts and feelings.\n",
      "then h ----  mind turned to the present, practical aspect of the situation.\n",
      "“it will not  ----  an easy search,” he remarked.\n",
      "“have you no clue to the spot where the furs  ----  hidden?” “none, except that it is a short way only from the place where the wrecked boat lies.” “where the boat lay when father left it,” commented hugh thoughtfully.\n",
      "“it may have drifted far from there by now.” “that  ----  possible.\n",
      "the boat  ----  driven on the rocks.\n",
      "that  ----  all i know.” “and his companion?\n",
      " ----  he drowned?” blaise shook his head.\n",
      "our father said nothing of black thunder, but i think he must be dead, or our father would not have come alone.” “how shall we set about the search?” “we will go down along the shore,” blaise replied, taking the lead as if by right, although he  ----  the younger by two or three years.\n",
      "when we have found that, we will make search for the cache of furs.” hugh’s thoughts turned to another part of h ----  half-brother’s tale.\n",
      "“tell me, blaise,” he said suddenly, “what  ----  it caused my father’s death, starvation, exhaustion, hardship?\n",
      "or  ----  he hurt when the boat was wrecked?\n",
      "you spoke of his blood-stained clothes.” “it  ----  not starvation and not cold,” the half-breed boy replied gravely.\n",
      "“he  ----  hurt, sore hurt.” the lad cast a swift glance about him, at the still and silent woods shadowy with approaching night.\n",
      "“our father  ----  sore hurt, but not in the wreck.\n",
      "the wound was in his side.” “but how c ---- e he by a wound?” hugh whispered, unconsciously imitating the other’s cautious manner.\n",
      "bla ---- e shook his black head solemnly.\n",
      "the wound  ----  a knife wound.” “what?” cried hugh, forgetting caution in his surprise.\n",
      "did someone murder him?” again bla ---- e shook his head.\n",
      "“it might have  ----  in fair fight.\n",
      "our father  ----  ever quick with word and deed.\n",
      "the bull moose himself  ----  not braver.\n",
      "yet i think the blow  ----  not a fair one.\n",
      "i think it  ----  struck from behind.\n",
      "the knife entered here.” bla ---- e placed his hand on a spot a little to the left of the back-bone.\n",
      "“a blow from behind it must have  ---- .\n",
      "could it have been h ----  companion who struck him?” “black thunder?\n",
      "our father would not have told us to go get them.” “true,” hugh replied, but after a moment of thought he added, “yet the fellow may have attacked him, and father, though mortally wounded, may have slain him.” a quick, fierce gle ----  shone in the younger boy’s bright eyes.\n",
      "“if he who struck was not killed by our father’s hand,” he said in a low, tense voice, “you and i  ----  left to avenge our father.” it was plain that christian schooling in quebec had not rooted out from little caribou’s nature the savage’s craving for revenge.\n",
      "to tell the truth, at the thought of that cowardly blow, hugh’s own feelings  ----  nearly as fierce as those of his half-indian brother.\n",
      "his duties over, he  ----  free to go where he would.\n",
      "to bapt ---- te’s queries, he replied that he had seen his half-brother and had arranged to accompany him to the grand portage.\n",
      "later he would come again to the k ---- inistikwia or return to the sault by the southerly route.\n",
      "having sat ---- fied the simple fellow’s curiosity, hugh went with him to visit the new fort.\n",
      "bapt ---- te had a great admiration for the fort.\n",
      "he obtained perm ---- sion to take his friend through the principal building and display to him the big dining hall.\n",
      "there, later in the year, at the time of the annual meeting, partners, agents and clerks would banquet together and d ---- cuss matters of the highest import to the fur trade.\n",
      "when the fort should  ----  completed, with all its storehouses and workshops, it would be almost a village within walls.\n",
      "outside the stockade was a shipyard and a tract of land cle ---- d for a garden.\n",
      "hugh, who had lived in the city of montreal,  ----  less impressed with the log structures, many of them still unfinished, than was the voyageur who had spent most of his days in the wilds.\n",
      "nevertheless the lad wondered at the size and  ---- bitiousness of this undertaking and accomplishment in the wilderness.\n",
      "far removed from the civilization of eastern canada, the trading post  ----  forced to be a little city in itself, dependent upon the real cities for nothing it could possibly make or obtain from the surrounding country.\n",
      "there, baptiste took him through the c ---- ps of indians, voyageurs and woodsmen or coureurs de bois, where bark lodges and tents and upturned canoes served as dwellings.\n",
      "in one of the wigw ---- s blaise was living, awaiting the time when he and his elder brother should start on their adventurous journey.\n",
      "already bla ---- e had provided himself with a good birch canoe, ribbed with cedar, and a few supplies, hulled corn, strips of smoked venison as hard and dry as wood, a lump of bear fat and a birch basket of maple sugar.\n",
      "he also had a blanket, a gun and  ---- munition, an iron kettle and a small axe.\n",
      "hugh had been able to bring nothing with him but a blanket, h ----  hunting knife and an extra shirt, but, as he had worked his passage, he still possessed a small sum of money.\n",
      "now that he  ----  no longer a member of the crew of the _otter_, he had no place to sleep and wondered what he should do.\n",
      "bla ---- e solved the problem by taking him about a mile up-river to the post of the new northwest or x y company, a much smaller and less pretentious place than the new fort, and introducing him to the clerk in charge.\n",
      "blaise had already explained that he and hugh  ----  going to get the elder beaupré’s furs and would bring them back to the new company’s post.\n",
      "so the clerk treated hugh in a most friendly manner, invited him to sh ----  his own house, and even offered to give him credit for the gun, canoe paddle and other things he needed.\n",
      "hugh, not knowing whether the search for the furs would  ----  successful, preferred to pay cash.\n",
      "from the x y clerk the lad learned that h ----  father, always proud and fiery of temper, had, the summer before, taken offence at one of the old company’s clerks.\n",
      "the outcome of the quarrel had been that beaupré had entered into a secret agreement with the new company, prom ---- ing to bring his pelts to them.\n",
      "the rivalry between the two organizations  ----  fierce and ruthless.\n",
      "both went on the principle that “all is fair in love or war,” and the relations between them  ----  very nearly those of war.\n",
      "the x y clerk even hinted that jean beaupré had probably been the victim of some of the old company’s men who had discovered that he  ----  carrying his furs to the rival post.\n",
      "hugh, during h ----  winter at the sault, had heard many tales of the wild deeds of the fur traders and had listened to the most bitter talk against the x y or new northwest company.\n",
      "accordingly he  ----  inclined to believe there might be some foundation for the agent’s suspicions.\n",
      "bla ---- e, however, took no heed of the man’s hints.\n",
      "when hugh mentioned his belief that his father had been murdered because of his change of allegiance, the younger boy shrugged his shoulders, a habit caught from his french p ---- nt.\n",
      "“that may be,” he replied, “but it is not in that direction _i_ shall look for the murderer.” and that  ----  the only comment he would make.\n",
      "to avoid curiosity and to keep their departure secret if possible, the boys decided not to go down the north branch of the k ---- inistikwia past the new fort, but upstream to the dividing point, then descend the lower or southern channel.\n",
      "up the river against the current they paddled between wooded shores veiled by the white, frosty m ---- t.\n",
      "hugh could not have found his way  ---- ong islands and around points and reefs, but his half-brother had come this route less than two weeks before.\n",
      "with the retentive memory and excellent sense of direction of the indian, he steered unhesitatingly around and  ---- ong the dim shapes.\n",
      "when the sun, breaking through the fog, showed him the shore line clearly, he gave a little grunt of sat ---- faction.\n",
      "he had kept his course and  ----  just where he had believed himself to be.\n",
      "th ----  feat of finding his way in the fog gave the elder brother some respect for the younger.\n",
      "before the day  ----  over, that respect had considerably increased.\n",
      "as the older boy  ----  also the heavier, he had taken his place in the stern, kneeling on his folded blanket.\n",
      "wielding a paddle  ----  not a new exercise to hugh.\n",
      "he thought that blaise set too easy a pace, and, anxious to prove that he  ----  no green hand, he quickened his own stroke.\n",
      "bla ---- e took the hint and timed his paddling to his brother’s.\n",
      "hugh  ----  sturdy, well knit and proud of his muscular strength.\n",
      "then h ----  stroke grew slower and he put less force into it.\n",
      "after a time bla ---- e suggested a few minutes’ rest.\n",
      "refreshed by this brief respite and ash ---- ed of tiring so soon, hugh resumed work with a more vigorous stroke, but it was blaise who set the pace now.\n",
      "in a clear, boy ---- h voice, which gave evidence in only an occasional note of beginning to break and roughen, he started an old french song, learned from his father, and kept time with his paddle.\n",
      "“je n’ai pas trouvé personne que le rossignol chantant la belle rose, la belle rose du rosier blanc!” roughly translated: “never yet have i found anyone but the nightingale, to sing of the lovely rose, the lovely rose of the white rose tree!” at first hugh, though h ----  voice broke and quavered, attempted to join in, but singing took breath and strength.\n",
      "he soon fell silent, content to dip and ra ---- e his blade in time to the younger lad’s tune.\n",
      "hugh  ---- gan to feel the strain sorely.\n",
      "his arms and back ached, his breath c ---- e wearily, and the lower part of his body was cramped and numb from his kneeling position.\n",
      "he had eaten breakfast at dawn and, as the sun climbed the sky and started down again, he began to wonder when and where h ----  indian brother intended to stop for the noon meal.\n"

      "he was touched by the generosity of the indian woman, who had put as much time and c ----  on these clothes for her unknown stepson as upon those for her own boy.\n",
      "he flushed, however, at the thought of accepting anything from the squaw who had taken h ----  mother’s place in his father’s life.\n",
      "yet to decline the gift would  ----  to offer a deadly insult not only to the indian woman but to her son as well.\n",
      "“i  ----  obliged to your mother,” hugh stammered.\n",
      "“it  ---- —kind of her.” blaise made no other reply than a nod.\n",
      "he appe ---- d pleased with the appearance and quality of the clothes, but took it as a matter of course that his mother should make them for hugh as well as for himself.\n",
      "“i w ---- h she had left more food,” he said after a moment, “but at this time of the year food is scarce.\n",

      "“it’s true we have seen pleasanter spots along this shore, yet this is not such a bad one.” “there  ----  evil stories of the place,” blaise repeated in a low voice.\n",
      "“the lake from which th ----  river flows is the abode of a devil.” the boy made the sign of the cross on his breast and went on in his musical singsong.\n",
      "“on the shores of that lake have  ----  found the devil’s tracks, great footprints, like those of a man, but many times larger and very far apart.\n",
      "so the lake is called the ‘lake of devil tracks’ and the river bears the s ---- e name.\n",
      "it is said that when that devil wishes to come down to the shore of the great lake to fish for trout, it is this way he comes, striding along the bed of the river, even at spring flood.” hugh beaupré, half scotch, half french, and living in a time when the superstitious beliefs of an earlier day persisted far more actively than they do now, was not without his sh ----  of such superstitions.\n",
      "but th ----  story of a devil living on a lake and walking along a river, struck him as absurd and he said so with perfect frankness.\n",

      "“men say they have seen the footprints and everyone knows there  ----  devils, both red and white.\n",

      "i  ----  no coward, as i will speedily show you if you want proof, but i will not camp here.\n",
      "we’ll go on till we find a better c ---- ping ground.” in the light of the afterglow, which was tinting sky and water with pale gold, soft rose and lavender, and tender blue, they launched their canoe again and paddled on.\n",
      "the peace and beauty around him made the sin ---- ter thing he had found under the raspberry bush, and the evil deed that thing suggested, seem unreal to hugh, almost as unreal as the devil who lived at the lake and walked down the river to his fishing.\n",
      "nevertheless he turned his eyes from the soft colors of sky and water to scan the shore the canoe  ----  skirting.\n",
      "not a trace of the wrecked bateau appe ---- d, though both boys watched closely.\n",
      "several miles beyond the devil track river, they made c ---- p on a sloping rock shore wooded with spruce and balsam, where nothing worse than a plague of greedy mosquitoes disturbed their rest.\n",
      "hugh thought of suggesting that the horde of voracious insects might have  ----  sent by the evil spirit of devil track lake to torment the trespassers.\n",
      "fearing however that a humorous treatment of h ----  story might offend the halfbreed lad’s sensitive pride, he kept the fancy to himself.\n",
      "going on with their journey the next morning, the two c ---- e to the spot known to the french fur traders and to the english who followed them as the grand marais, the great marsh or meadow.\n",
      "there a long sand and gravel point connects with a low, marshy shore, a higher, rocky stretch, once a reef or  ---- land, running at right angles to the gravel spit.\n",
      "closely scanning every foot of beach and rock shore, hugh and blaise paddled around the t. on the inner side of the spit, they caught sight of what appe ---- d to be part of a boat half buried in the sand and gravel.\n",
      "the thing  ----  indeed the shattered remnants of a wreck, old and weathered and deep in sand and pebbles.\n",
      "it  ----  not jean beaupré’s boat, but a birch canoe.\n",
      "when they rounded the little point beyond, they d ---- covered that the waves, which had been increasing for some hours, had reached a height dangerous to a small boat.\n",
      "the time  ----  past noon, and blaise thought that the sea would not be likely to go down before sunset.\n",
      "so he gave the word to turn back and seek a c ---- ping ground.\n",
      "realizing that they must conserve their scanty food supply, the two, instead of eating at once, went f ---- hing in the sheltered water.\n",
      "hugh, in the stern of the canoe, held the hand line, while bla ---- e paddled.\n",

      "caution is never  ---- ted, my brother.” forced to discontinue the journey for most of the day, the lads spent the time seeking food.\n",
      "they were far enough from ohrante’s c ---- p to have little fear that any of his party would hear their shots, yet they chose to hunt to the north rather than to the south.\n",
      "with some of the dry powder and the shot that had been saved, bla ---- e started out first, while hugh spread the wet powder to dry on a flat rock exposed to the sun but sheltered from the wind.\n",
      "then he cleaned and dried his gun and greased it with pork fat before leaving c ---- p.\n",
      "hugh wandered the woods in search of g ---- e for several hours.\n",
      "traversing the thick woods, where there  ----  much undergrowth, was difficult and he did not greatly trust his own woodcraft.\n",
      "he had no w ---- h to humiliate himself in his half-brother’s eyes by losing his way.\n",
      "moreover, as long as he kept where the wind reached him, he  ----  not much annoyed by the mosquitoes, at their worst in june.\n",
      "whenever he reached a spot where the wind did not penetrate, the irritating insects c ---- e about him in clouds, settling on his hands, face, wrists and neck and even getting inside his rather low necked, deerskin shirt.\n",
      "whether he did not go far enough into the woods or for some other reason, his luck  ----  not good.\n",
      "he shot a squirrel and a long-e ---- d, northern hare or snowshoe rabbit and missed another, but did not catch a glimpse of deer, moose, or bear.\n",
      "neither squirrel nor rabbit meat  ----  at its best in june, but it was at least better than no meat at all.\n",
      "carrying h ----  meager bag, he returned late in the afternoon.\n",
      "he found bla ---- e squatting over a small cooking fire.\n",
      "in the lake superior wilderness of that day no laws prohibited the shooting of g ---- e birds out of season.\n",
      "the stew which appealed so strongly to hugh’s nostrils  ----  made up of grouse and squirrel meat, with a very little salt pork to give it savor.\n",
      "the wind had fallen and since noon the waves had  ----  going down.\n",
      "by sunset, though the lake  ----  by no means smooth, travel had become possible for skilled canoeists.\n",
      "had hugh and bla ---- e not been in such a hurry to put distance between themselves and ohrante, they would have waited until morning.\n",
      "they  ----  so anxious to go on that they launched the canoe while the afterglow was still reflected in pink and lavender on the eastern sky.\n",
      "a few miles would bring them to the devil track river, but, not choosing to c ---- p in that evil spot, blaise insisted on landing about a mile below the stream mouth.\n",
      "leaving their c ---- p early next morning, the two started overland to the devil track.\n",
      "weary and disheartened they returned to their c ---- ping place, hugh in the lead.\n",
      "the elder brother’s sharp excl ---- ation when he reached the spot made the younger one hasten to his side.\n",
      "bla ---- e did not need to be told to look.\n",
      "the ragged, gaping hole in the bark  ----  too conspicuous.\n",
      "“it  ----  the devil in the form of a porcupine, i think,” hugh muttered.\n",
      "“what possessed the beast?” “he smelled the pork and gnawed h ----  way through to it.\n",
      "we will see.” blaise  ----  right.\n",
      "when the canoe  ----  lifted, the boys discovered that the small chunk of salt pork was gone, taken out through the hole the beast had gnawed.\n",
      "nothing else  ----  missing.\n",
      "“either he didn’t like the other things or the pork  ----  all he could carry away at one trip,” said hugh.\n",
      "“if we had stayed away a little longer, he might have made off with the corn and the sugar as well.” “the loss of the pork  ----  bad,” blaise commented gravely.\n",
      "“the hole in the canoe is bad also, and we must delay to mend it.” the loss of the pork  ----  indeed serious.\n",
      "the rabbit and the squirrel hugh had shot the day before had  ----  eaten, and nothing else remained but a few handfuls of corn and a little sugar.\n"

      "in spite of the fact that the boys, on their way down the shore, had searched the land to the east of the devil track with considerable thoroughness, they  ----  determined to go over it again.\n",
      "by means of a fallen tree and the boulders that rose above the fo ---- ing rapids, they crossed the river where it narrowed between rock walls.\n",
      "late in the afternoon, blaise, scr ---- bling up a steep and stony slope well back from the stream, heard two shots in quick succession and then a third at a longer interval, the signal agreed upon to indicate that one or the other had come across something significant.\n",
      "the sounds c ---- e from the direction of the lake, and blaise hastened down to the shore.\n",
      "xiii the painted thwart bla ---- e found hugh stooping over a heap of shattered, water-stained boards, crude planks, axe hewn from the tree.\n",
      "“can th ----  be the boat, do you think?” hugh asked.\n",
      "bla ---- e shook his head doubtfully.\n",
      "“it was not here on the beach when we c ---- e this way before.” “yet it may be part of the wreck washed from some outer rock and cast here by that last hard blow,” reasoned the older boy.\n",
      "“that  ----  possible.\n",
      "if we could find more of it, the part that  ---- ars the sign——” “what sign?\n",
      "i have often wondered how, if we found a wrecked boat, we should know whether it  ----  the right one.” “surely i told you of the sign.\n",
      "the board that bears the hole for the mast is painted with vermilion, and on it in black is our father’s sign, the figure that means his ojibwa n ---- e, ‘man with the bright eyes, the eyes that make sparks.’ twice the sign is there, once on each side of the mast.” hugh was staring at his younger brother.\n",
      "then he remem ---- red.\n",
      "“show me, blaise,” he cried, “what that figure looks like, that means father’s indian n ---- e.” blaise picked up a smooth gray flake and with a bit of softer, dark red stone scratched the figure.\n",
      "“that  ----  it,” hugh exclaimed.\n",
      "“i have seen that wrecked boat, a bateau with the thwart painted red and that very s ---- e figure drawn in black.” “you have seen it?” the younger brother looked at the elder wonderingly.\n",
      "“in your dre ---- s?” “no, i was wide awake, but it was a long way from here and before ever i saw you, blaise.” rapidly hugh related how he and baptiste had examined the old bateau in the cleft of the rocks of the isle royale.\n",
      "bla ---- e listened in silence, only his eyes betraying his interest.\n",
      "“truly we know not where to search,” he said when hugh had fin ---- hed.\n",
      "how can we find where it went upon the rocks?” “i don’t  ---- lieve it drifted far.\n",
      "if it was so badly d ---- aged father had to abandon it, could it have floated far?\n",
      "when that boat was carried across to isle royale, i believe father and black thunder  ----  still in it with all their furs.\n",
      "the storm drove them out into the lake, they lost their  ---- arings, just as we in the _otter_ did.\n",
      "they  ----  borne away and dashed by the waves into that crack in the rocks.\n",
      "near there somewhere we shall find the cache, if we find it at all.” hugh spoke confidently, very sure of his own reasoning, but the younger lad  ----  not so easily convinced.\n",
      "“how,” blaise questioned, “did he come away from that island minong if he  ----  wrecked there?\n",
      "he could not come by land and the bateau is still there.” “he made himself a dugout or birch canoe to cross in when the weather cleared.” “but then why c ---- e he not to wauswaugoning by canoe?” “because,” persisted hugh, “when he reached the mainland he fell in with some enemy here at the devil track river.\n",
      "we know his wound  ----  not received in the wreck.\n",
      "you yourself say it  ----  a knife wound.\n",
      "black thunder  ---- n’t killed in the wreck either.\n",

      "so they built a canoe and crossed to th ----  shore.\n",
      "here they  ----  set upon and black thunder was killed and father sorely wounded.” again the sceptical blaise shook his head.\n",
      "“why  ----  they away down here so far below the grand portage?\n",
      "and why, if they had a canoe, brought they not the furs and the packet with them?” hugh was aw ----  of the weak links in his theory, yet he clung to it.\n",
      "“may ----  they did bring them,” he said, “but couldn’t carry them overland, so they hid them.” “no, no.\n",
      "our father told me that the furs  ----  not far from the wreck.\n",
      "i cannot be mistaken.” “perhaps their canoe  ---- n’t big enough to hold all of the pelts,” hugh speculated.\n",
      "but,” he admitted honestly, “i don’t quite understand how they c ---- e to be so far down the shore here, and, if the packet is valuable, why didn’t father bring that with him if he brought anything?\n",
      "and why didn’t he tell you that the storm drove him on isle royale?” “you forget,” blaise said slowly, “that our father’s body  ----  very weak and his spirit just about to leave it.\n",
      "he told me of the way it  ----  marked, but he could say no more.\n",
      "i think he could not hear my questions.” both lads were silent for several minutes, then hugh said decisively, “well, blaise, there  ----  just two things we can do, unless we give up the quest entirely.\n",
      "we can go back down the shore, searching the land for some sign of the cache, or we can cross to  ---- le royale, find the cleft in the rocks where the bateau lies, and seek there for the furs and the packet.\n",
      "i  ----  for the latter plan.\n",
      "to search the whole shore from here to the fond du lac for a hidden cache to which we have no clue seems to me a hopeless task.” “but to cross that long stretch of open water in a small canoe,” bla ---- e returned doubtfully.\n",
      "“we must choose good weather of course, and paddle our swiftest to reach the  ---- land before a change comes.\n",
      "perhaps we can rig some kind of sail and make better time than with our paddles.” it  ----  plain that hugh had made up his mind to return to isle royale.\n",
      "hitherto he had been content to let blaise take the lead, but now he  ----  asserting his elder brother’s right to leadership.\n",
      "better than his white brother, blaise understood the hazards of such an undertaking, but the half-breed lad  ----  proud.\n",
      "he  ----  not going to admit himself less courageous than his elder brother.\n",
      "if hugh d ---- d take the risk, he, little caribou, as his mother’s people called him, dared take it also.\n",
      "the brothers must prov ---- ion themselves for the trip.\n",
      "even if they reached the  ---- land safely and in good time, they could not guess how long their search might take, or how many days or weeks they might be delayed before they could return.\n",
      "fresh supplies might have reached the grand portage by now and corn at least could  ----  bought.\n",
      "from the indians always to  ----  found near the posts, other food supplies and new moccasins might be obtained.\n",
      "they decided to devote the remaining hours of daylight to f ---- hing for their supper.\n",
      "bla ---- e paddled slowly along a submerged reef some distance out from shore, while hugh fished.\n",
      "in a very few minutes he felt a pull at h ----  line.\n",
      "hand over hand he hauled it in, bla ---- e helping by managing the canoe so that the line did not slacken even for an instant.\n",
      "nearer and nearer hugh drew his prize, until he could see the gle ---- ing silver of the big fish flashing through the clear water.\n",
      "then c ---- e the critical moment.\n",
      "he had no landing net, and reaching over the side with net or gaff would have been a r ---- k at best.\n",
      "without shifting his weight enough to destroy the balance, while blaise endeavored to hold the canoe steady with his paddle, hugh must land his fish squ ---- ly in the bottom.\n",
      "with a sudden swing, the long, silvery, dark-flecked body, tail wildly flapping,  ----  raised from the water and flung into the canoe.\n",
      "almost before it touched the bottom, hugh had seized h ----  knife and dealt a swift blow.\n",
      "a few ineffectual flaps and the big f ---- h lay still.\n",
      "“i have seen larger trout, but most of them  ----  taken in nets.” “they grow very big sometimes, two, three times as big, but it is not good to catch such a big one with a line.\n",
      "unless you have great luck, it overturns your canoe.” the sight of the big trout sharpened the boys’ hunger pangs and took away all zest from further f ---- hing.\n",
      "“that  ----  not the _otter_,” hugh remarked as they paddled by.\n",
      "“no, it  ----  not one of the old company’s ships.\n",
      "i think it belongs to the new company.” “i’m glad it  ---- n’t the _otter_,” hugh replied.\n",
      "“i shouldn’t know how to answer bapt ---- te’s questions.” the ship proved, as blaise had guessed, to belong to the new company.\n",
      "she sailed the day after the boys arrived, but had left  ---- ple supplies.\n",
      "they had no difficulty in buying the needed stores, though hugh’s money  ----  exhausted by the purchases.\n",
      "he left explanations to bla ---- e, confident that his younger brother could not be persuaded to divulge the destination or purpose of their trip.\n",
      "the last day of their stay, when they were returning from the new company’s post, they c ---- e upon the camp of the trappers whose bateau had loomed like a ship through the morning mist when the boys were leaving the bay of the beaver.\n",
      "hugh recognized at once the tall fellow in the scarlet cap who had replied to h ----  shout of greeting.\n",
      "the trappers had disposed of their furs at the old company’s post and  ----  about to leave.\n",
      "they  ----  going to portage their supplies to fort charlotte above the falls of the pigeon river and go up the river in a canoe.\n",

      "“you want it?” the leader questioned in h ----  big voice.\n",

      "there  ----  no mistaking that high towering shore, steep rocks at the base, richly forest clad above.\n",

      "though he spoke quietly, his disappointment  ----  as strong as hugh’s.\n",
      "“that someone  ----  probably one of the old company’s men.\n",
      "then the furs  ----  lost to us indeed.\n",
      "it may have been black thunder of course, but then what  ----  the meaning of the blood-stained shirt?\n",
      "no, we don’t know, bla ---- e.\n",
      "our furs may  ----  gone for good, but we can’t be sure.\n",
      "father may have put them in there out of reach of the storm and later moved them to some other place, or they may never have  ----  in that hole at all.\n",

      "that would  ----  folly.\n",
      "we must go back.” the two returned to the wreck and clim ---- d up the way they had come down.\n",
      "when at sunset they gave up the search for that day, their fear that the furs had  ----  stolen from the hole in the rock had grown near to a certainty.\n",
      "well-nigh d ---- couraged, they went back to the beach in the shallow cove where they had left their boat.\n",
      "“why  ----  it, blaise,” hugh asked, as they sat by the fire waiting for the kettle to boil, “that no indians dwell on this big island?\n",
      "it is a beautiful place and there must be g ---- e and furs for the hunting.” blaise gave his characteristic french shrug.\n",
      "“i know not if there is much g ---- e, and minong is far from the mainland.\n",
      "i have heard that there  ----  great store of copper in the rocks.\n",
      "the ojib ----  say that the island was made by the giant kepoochikan.\n",
      "once upon a time the f ---- h quarrelled with kepoochikan and tried to drown him by making a great flood.\n",
      "but he built a big floating island and made it rich with copper and there he took his f ---- ily and all the kinds of birds and beasts there are.\n",
      "when the water, which had spread over the whole earth, stopped r ---- ing, he told a gull to dive down to the bottom and bring up some mud.\n",
      "the gull could not dive so far, but drowned  ---- fore he reached the bottom.\n",
      "then kepoochikan sent a  ---- aver.\n",
      "the beaver c ---- e up almost drowned, but with a ball of mud clutched tight in his hands.\n",
      "kepoochikan took the mud and made a new earth, but he kept the  ---- land minong for his home.\n",
      "after many years there  ----  another giant, the great nanibozho, who was chief of all the indians on the new land kepoochikan had made.\n",
      "nanibozho  ----  a good manito and kepoochikan a bad one.\n",
      "the boulder  ----  here on minong yet they say.\n",
      "since then nanibozho has guarded the copper of minong, though some say h ----  real dwelling place is on thunder cape.\n",
      "off the shore and in the channels of minong he has set sharp rocks to destroy the canoes that approach the  ---- land, and he has many spirits to help him guard the treasure.” “that is only a tale, of course,” said hugh somewhat disdainfully.\n",
      "“we of the ship _otter_ c ---- ped here several days and we saw or heard no spirits.\n",
      "we found nothing to fear.” “you sought no copper,”  ----  the retort.\n",
      "“it  ----  said that sometimes kepoochikan and nanibozho fight together on the rocks and hurl great boulders about.\n",
      "strange tales there  ----  too of the thick forest, of the little lakes and bays.\n",
      "there  ----  one place called the bay of manitos, where, so i have heard, dwell giant windigos and great serpents and huge birds and spirits that mock the lonely traveller with shouts and threats and laughter.” “surely you do not believe such tales, blaise,” hugh protested, “or fear such spirits.” “i know that neither kepoochikan nor nanibozho made the world,” the younger boy replied seriously.\n",
      "but whether the tales of giants and spirits  ----  true, i know not.\n",
      "to believe or be inclined to believe such tales and yet to come to the enchanted  ---- land, to come with only one companion, surely proved his half-brother’s courage.\n",
      "he had come to know bla ---- e too well.\n",
      "xvi the cache the night being clear, the boys did not trouble to prep ----  a shelter.\n",
      "they merely cut some bals ----  branches and spread them smoothly on the beach.\n",
      "c ---- p, on the trip down and up the main shore, had, to be sure, usually been made far from the camps of other men.\n",
      "but there _ ---- _ men, both red and white, on that shore.\n",
      "when the lake  ----  not too rough, there was always the chance that the sound of human voices and the dip of paddles might be heard at any time during the night, as a canoe passed in the starlight.\n",
      "here, however, the whole length and breadth of the great  ---- land,—which the two lads believed even larger than it really is, some fifty miles in length and twelve or fourteen broad at its widest part,—there lived, so far as they knew, not one human being.\n",

      "there  ----  moonlight in the pit, but the cache, close under the rock wall, was in the shadow.\n",

      "before loading, the bateau had to be pushed out a little way, bla ---- e standing in the water to hold it while hugh piled in the bales.\n",
      "then both clim ---- d in and paddled quietly out of the crack.\n",
      "there  ----  not breeze enough for sailing.\n",
      "hugh and blaise  ----  anxious to get away from the spot where they had found the furs and had heard the shout, but paddling the heavily laden bateau was slow work.\n",
      "without a breeze to fill the sail, they  ----  loth to start across the open lake, so they kept on along shore to the northeast.\n",
      "when they had put a mile or more between themselves and the place where they had found the furs, they would c ---- p and wait for sunrise and a breeze.\n",
      "the dark, forest-crowned rocks, huge, worn and se ---- ed pillars, towered forbiddingly on the other side.\n",
      "at last the wider view of the water ahead and the barrenness of the tumbled rocks to the right indicated that they  ----  reaching the end of the shore along which they had been travelling.\n",
      "“we’ll land now,” said hugh, “as soon as we can find a place.” the abrupt, truncated pillars of rock  ----  not so high here, but were bordered at the water’s edge with broken blocks and great boulders, affording little chance of a landing place.\n",
      "by paddling close in, however, slowly and cautiously to avoid d ---- aster, the boys discovered a niche between two blocks of rock, with water deep enough to permit running the boat in.\n",
      "there they clim ---- d out on the rock and secured the bateau by a couple of turns of the rope around a smaller block.\n",
      "in rough weather such a landing would have been impossible, but on this still night there  ----  no danger of the bateau bumping upon the rocks.\n",
      "farther along bla ---- e found a spot where the solid rock shelved down gradually.\n",
      "rolling themselves in their blankets, the brothers stretched out on the hard  ---- d.\n",
      "the plaintive crying of gulls waked hugh just as the sun  ----  coming up from the water, a great red ball in the morning mist.\n",
      "“i don’t like th ----  place,” he said as he sat up.\n",
      "“we can be seen plainly from the lake.” “yes,” bla ---- e agreed, “but we can see far across the lake.\n",
      "if a boat comes, we shall see it while it  ----  yet a long way off.\n",
      "no, the only way an enemy can draw near unseen  ----  from the land, from the woods farther back there.” “the water is absolutely still,” hugh went on.\n",
      "“there  ---- n’t a capful of wind to fill our sail, and we can’t paddle this loaded boat clear across to the mainland.\n",
      "we must find a better place than th ---- , though, to wait for a breeze.\n",
      "i  ----  going to look around a bit.” the lads soon found that they were near the end of a point, a worn, wave-eaten, rock point, bare except for a few scraggly bushes, clumps of dwarfed white cedar and such mosses and lichens as could cling to the surface.\n",
      "farther back  ----  woods, mostly evergreen.\n",
      "the two felt that they must find a spot where they could wait for a wind without being v ---- ible from the woods.\n",
      "at the very tip of the point, the slate-gray rocks  ----  abrupt, slightly overhanging indeed, but in one spot there lay exposed at the base a few feet of low, shelving, wave-smoothed shore, which must be under water in rough weather.\n",
      "on this calm day the lower rock shore  ----  dry.\n",
      "there, in the shelter of the overhanging masses, the boys would  ----  entirely concealed from the land side.\n",
      "between the rock tower and the place they had selected for themselves  ----  a narrow inlet where the bateau would be fairly well hidden.\n",
      "they shoved the boat out from  ---- tween the boulders, where it had lain safe while they slept, and paddled around to the little inlet.\n",
      "on the wave-smoothed, low rock shore, they kindled a tiny fire of dry sticks gathered at the edge of the woods, and hung the kettle from a pole slanted over the fl ---- es from a cranny in the steep rock at the rear.\n",
      "the delay  ----  trying, especially to the impetuous hugh.\n",
      "they had found the cache, secured the furs and the packet, and had got safely away with them, only to be stuck here on the end of th ----  point for hours of idle waiting.\n",
      "paddling the bateau had been laborious enough when it  ----  empty, but now, laden almost to the water-line, the boat was far worse to handle.\n",
      "propelling it  ----  not merely hard work, but progress would be so slow that the journey across to the mainland would be a long one, with always the chance that the wind, when it did come, might blow from the wrong quarter.\n",
      "to attempt to paddle it against wind and waves would invite d ---- aster.\n",
      "sailing the clumsy craft, heavy laden as it  ---- , across the open water with a fair wind would be quite perilous enough.\n",

      "“i’m going over there to see if everything is all right.” to reach the boat, he  ----  obliged to climb to his peeping place and pull himself up the rest of the way, or else go around and across the top of the steep rocks.\n",

      "when it c ---- e to feeling the way past the round islet and through the narrow passage, hugh ceased paddling and trusted entirely to blaise.\n",
      "the latter strained his eyes in the effort to see into the darkness, but so black  ----  it on every hand that even he had to depend more on feeling with his paddle blade than on his sense of sight.\n",

      "this  ----  by no means the first time hugh had been through untracked woods and over rough ground, yet he found the trip to the ridge top longer and more difficult than he had expected.\n",

      "sometimes he found it firm beneath h ----  feet, again he would sink half-way to his knees.\n",
      "the rise on this side of the point was gradual comp ---- d with the abrupt cliffs of the northwest side, but the slope proved to be, not an unbroken grade, but an irregular succession of low ridges with shallow gullies between.\n",
      "by the general upward trend, occasional glimpses of the water behind him, and the angle at which the sunlight c ---- e through the trees, hugh kept his main direction, going in as straight a line as he could.\n",

      "though he was in too great a hurry to take any particular c ----  to avoid leaving footprints, hugh did not mark his trail intentionally and even refrained from cutting his way through the thick places.\n",
      "the whole d ---- tance from the shore to the summit of the highest ridge probably did not exceed a mile, and did not actually take as long as it seemed in the climbing.\n",

      "the direction, a little east of north, was not unfavorable for reaching the mainland, though steering a straight course for the k ---- inistikwia would be impossible.\n",
      "he gave a gasp, almost lost h ----  footing, and seized a sturdy juniper root to keep himself from falling.\n",
      "directly above him, on the verge of the ridge, stood a strange man, from h ----  features, dark skin and long black hair evidently an indian,—but not ohrante.\n",

      "hugh knew himself to  ----  in a bad position.\n",
      "probably the indian was one of ohrante’s followers, and they  ----  a wild crew, outlaws and renegades, their hand against every man and every man’s hand against them.\n",

      "“bo jou,” hugh said, using the corruption of the french “bon jour” common  ---- ong traders and indians.\n",
      "both  ----  silent for a moment.\n",
      "suddenly hugh made up h ----  mind, resolving on a bold course.\n",
      "“what  ----  this place?” he asked.\n",
      "“is it island or mainland?” “ne compr’ney,”  ----  the only answer.\n",

      "he repeated his questions in french, then tried english, but the indian merely stared at him, the sardonic grin still distorting his lips, and replied in the s ---- e manner.\n",
      "either he really did not understand, the two french phrases being all the white man’s speech he knew, or he did not w ---- h to talk.\n",
      "“i  ----  driven here in the storm last night,” he volunteered, “and my canoe wrecked and my companion drowned.\n",

      "the fellow merely repeated his singsong “ne compr’ney.” there  ----  no use saying more.\n",
      "determined not to show that he expected or fe ---- d any violence, hugh started to climb up the projecting rock.\n",
      "somewhat to the boy’s surpr ---- e, the indian made no move to stop him.\n",

      "resistance  ----  useless.\n",
      "“what do you mean?” he cried, trying to make h ----  meaning plain by his voice and manner even though his captor could not understand the words.\n",
      "“what do you mean by threatening me, a white man, with your musket?” the gun  ----  moved back a trifle, but the bronze face continued to grin maliciously.\n",
      "to show that he was not afraid, hugh took a step forward, and opened his mouth to speak again, but the words  ----  not uttered.\n",
      "as his weight shifted to his forward foot, he  ----  seized from behind, and thrown sidewise, his head crashing against the trunk of a tree.\n",

      "the white boy thought he had been c ---- ful about leaving a trail, but to the half-breed lad the indications were plain enough.\n",
      "most of the tracks  ----  such as might have been made by any large animal, but blaise knew hugh had landed at this spot intending to go directly to the ridge top.\n",
      "the younger boy was confident that tr ---- pled undergrowth, prints in the leaf mould, freshly broken branches, were all signs of his brother’s passage.\n",
      "at first he followed the trail easily, but the long northern twilight  ----  waning.\n",
      "bla ---- e had no wish to attract attention by lighting a torch.\n",
      "as he penetrated the thick growth, he  ----  not only unable to find hugh’s trail, but was obliged sometimes to feel his own way and was in grave doubt whether he was going aright.\n",
      "coming out into a more open spot, where several trees had fallen, he ex ---- ined, as well as he could in the dim light, the moss-covered trunks for some sign that hugh had climbed over them.\n",

      "it was evident that in this c ---- p there were no squaws, or the braves would not be doing squaws’ work.\n",
      "growing tired of watching h ----  guard at his task, hugh closed his eyes.\n",
      "the sun  ----  warm and in this sheltered place there was little breeze.\n",
      "he opened h ----  eyes to find, looking down on him, the young indian and a repulsive fellow with a strip of dirty red cloth bound about his black hair.\n",
      "the latter had evidently just come from visiting his sn ---- s, for he was carrying two rabbits.\n",
      "when he saw that hugh  ----  awake, he turned away, the young fellow, after favoring the boy with another of his malicious grins, following him.\n",
      "from the position of the sun hugh knew that he had not slept long, but h ----  head felt better and the sick feeling had passed.\n",
      "at least one of the indians  ----  in sight and hearing every moment.\n",

      "he strove to lie quiet and to keep h ----  feelings of discomfort, anxiety and apprehension from his face.\n",
      "the ground  ----  hard, the sun beat down upon his head and face, and he could not move to a more comfortable spot.\n",
      "only with difficulty could he roll over on h ----  side.\n",

      "why  ----  he treated in this way?\n",
      "what  ----  they going to do to him and for what or whom were they waiting?\n",
      "the one possible explanation of his treatment  ----  that he had fallen into the hands of ohrante’s little band of outlaws.\n",
      "why should even they want to take him pr ---- oner?\n",
      " ----  ohrante looking for the hidden cache?\n",

      "the young fellow ceased h ----  flute playing and followed, the other remaining to watch the stew.\n",
      "he rolled over on h ----  side, and saw, striding towards him—ohrante.\n",
      "there could be no mistaking that huge form, looking more gigantic than ever as it to ---- d over the prostrate lad.\n",
      "ohrante  ----  not less than seven feet in height, with proportionate breadth of shoulder and depth of chest.\n",
      "it  ----  not an ugly face.\n",
      "in its outlines and proportions, its strongly cut, regular features, it  ----  unusually handsome for an indian.\n",
      "but there  ----  an inhuman hardness about it, a fiercely piercing quality in the eyes, cruel lines about nostrils and lips, a general expression of bitter and vindictive malevolence that appalled the boy.\n",
      "a shudder passed through him, yet, fascinated, he could not take h ----  eyes from the dark, piercing ones.\n",
      "ohrante spoke, and hugh gave a start of surpr ---- e.\n",
      "it was not the words that  ---- azed him.\n",
      "all the indian said was, “who  ----  you, white man?\n",
      "how come you here?” a simple question in curiously accented engl ---- h.\n",
      "it  ----  the voice that surprised hugh.\n",
      "weak, high pitched, almost squeaking, such a voice as the boy had never heard in an indian before, it  ----  ludicrously incongruous with the size and appearance of the evil giant.\n",
      "instantly the spell in which ohrante had held him  ----  broken.\n",
      "so great  ----  the revulsion of feeling that hugh actually wanted to laugh.\n",
      "luckily he realized that to take any notice of the giant’s weak point would surely arouse h ----  bitterest hatred.\n",
      "self-possession regained, hugh controlled his features and ans ---- d steadily.\n",
      "he had had plenty of time that long afternoon to plan the story he  ----  to tell.\n",
      "“i  ----  hugh mcnair.\n",
      "i c ---- e here by accident.\n",
      "high winds drove me out of my course and against the great rocks yonder.” he jerked h ----  head in the direction of the mouth of the bay.\n",
      "“my canoe  ----  wrecked, all my winter supplies lost, my comrade drowned.” he paused, rather surprised at the readiness with which he told his false tale.\n",
      "ordinarily hugh was truthful, inclined to regard a lie as a coward’s refuge, but he had no intention of divulging his true n ---- e and purpose to his father’s bitterest enemy.\n",
      "“minong far from mainland,” he said in h ----  bad english.\n",
      "he was suspicious of the tale, but the boy was prep ---- d for doubt.\n",
      "“we were going from the new fort at the k ---- inistikwia,” hugh went on to explain.\n",
      "also we  ----  very sleepy.\n",
      "we had drunk deep and we did not take c ----  where we went.\n",
      "then c ---- e the wind.” hugh was watching ohrante’s face closely, but he could not tell whether the iroquois believed the story or not, or indeed how much of it he understood.\n",
      "he made no reply except a queer little sound in h ----  throat.\n",
      "because of his high-pitched voice, that sound could not be called a grunt, and hugh  ----  at a loss to know whether it meant assent, disbelief or contempt.\n",
      "before he could add anything more to h ----  story, the giant turned abruptly away, walked over to the fire and seated himself on a log.\n",
      "immediately one of h ----  followers removed the pot, and, with a long-handled, crudely carved wooden spoon, ladled out a generous portion of the stew into a birch bark dish.\n",
      "the chief received the d ---- h in silence and commenced to eat, picking out the bits of meat on the point of his knife, and taking up the rice on the flat of the blade.\n",
      "after he had fin ---- hed the more solid part of the food, he drank the soup and passed the dish back to be refilled.\n",
      "the other indians, eight in num ---- r, stood or sat about in silence.\n",
      "not until the chief had fin ---- hed his second portion and had signified, by turning the empty dish upside down on the ground, that he had had enough, did they venture to approach the kettle, each with his own bark or wooden bowl.\n",
      "ohrante said something to the squat man who had  ----  one of hugh’s captors, pointing to the boy as he spoke.\n",
      "at once the man, carrying h ----  own dish of stew, went over to the captive, seated himself cross-legged beside him, took up a piece of meat on the point of his knife and held it to hugh’s lips.\n",
      "in th ----  way he fed the lad about half the contents of the dish, reserving the rest for himself for fear the kettle might be empty.\n",
      "neither the wooden dish nor the knife blade  ----  very clean, but hugh was too hungry to be particular.\n",
      "he could have eaten more, but he  ----  thankful to get anything.\n",
      "whatever the fate in store for him, he was app ---- ntly not to be starved to death.\n",
      "he r ---- ked asking for a drink, making signs to explain his meaning, and the indian brought him some water from the lake in a bark cup.\n",
      "napoleon bonaparte (french: napoléon bonaparte [napoleɔ̃ bɔnɑpaʁt], italian: napoleone buonaparte; 15 august 1769 – 5 may 1821)  ----  a french military and political leader who rose to prominence during the latter stages of the french revolution and its associated wars in europe.\n",
      "as napoleon i, he  ----  emperor of the french from 1804 to 1815, the first monarch of france bearing the title emperor since the reign of charles the fat (881-887).\n",
      "h ----  legal reform, the napoleonic code, has been a major influence on many civil law jurisdictions worldwide, but he is best remembered for his role in the wars led against france by a series of coalitions, the so-called napoleonic wars.\n",
      "he establ ---- hed hegemony over most of continental europe and sought to spread the ideals of the french revolution, while consolidating an imperial monarchy which restored aspects of the deposed ancien régime.\n",
      "due to his success in these wars, often against numerically superior enemies, he is generally regarded as one of the greatest military commanders of all time, and his c ---- paigns are studied at military academies worldwide.\n",
      "[1] napoleon was born at ajaccio in corsica in a f ---- ily of noble italian ancestry which had settled corsica in the 16th century.\n",
      "he rose to prominence under the french first republic and led successful c ---- paigns against the first and second coalitions arrayed against france.\n",
      "in 1799, he staged a coup d'état and installed himself as first consul; five years later the french senate proclaimed him emperor, following a pleb ---- cite in his favour.\n",
      "he elevated his f ---- ily to form the imperial house of france and installed them as rulers of vassal states.\n",
      "[1] after a streak of victories, france secured a dominant position in continental europe, and napoleon maintained the french sphere of influence through the formation of extensive alliances and the appointment of friends and f ---- ily members to rule other european countries as french client states.\n",
      "his grande armée was badly d ---- aged in the campaign and never fully recovered.\n",
      "in 1813, the sixth coalition defeated h ----  forces at leipzig; the following year the coalition invaded france, forced napoleon to abdicate and exiled him to the island of elba.\n",
      "less than a year later, he escaped elba and returned to power, but  ----  defeated at the battle of waterloo in june 1815. napoleon spent the last six years of his life in confinement by the british on the island of saint helena.\n",
      "an autopsy concluded he died of stomach cancer, but there has been some debate about the cause of his death, as some scholars have speculated that he  ----  a victim of arsenic poisoning.\n",
      "he  ----  left lying bound and was not even given a blanket.\n",
      "early in the evening, ohrante retired alone to the smaller of the two wigw ---- s, and a little later the others, all except the young fellow with the malicious grin, crowded into the larger dwelling.\n",
      "the young indian, rolled in a dirty blanket, lay down on the opposite side of the fire from the pr ---- oner.\n",
      "hugh’s arms and legs had grown so numb that he no longer felt the galling of the cords, but he  ----  very sore and uncomfortable from lying on the hard ground.\n",
      "he had no wish to sleep, he  ----  too eager to find some means of escape.\n",
      "if he could bring h ----  bonds in contact with a coal from the fire, he might burn them enough so that he could pull them apart.\n",
      "he hitched ne ---- r the flickering blaze and turned on his side towards it.\n",
      "the light  ----  full on the face of the indian beyond.\n",
      "hugh could see that the man’s eyes  ----  open and fixed upon him.\n",
      "his lips  ----  grinning in the evil fashion the boy knew all too well.\n",
      "hugh settled himself as comfortably as he could and closed h ----  eyes.\n",
      "the captive opened his eyes and, cautiously and with painful effort, rolled ne ---- r to the fire.\n",
      "there  ----  a low grunt from the indian.\n",
      "he rose, c ---- e over to hugh, seized him by the shoulder and roughly dragged him back from the fire.\n",
      "the rope  ----  long and did not prevent hugh from lying down and turning from side to side, but it effectually anchored him too far from the fire to put his plan into operation.\n",
      "h ----  guard had probably divined his intention.\n",
      "there  ----  nothing left for him but to sleep, if he could, and gather strength and courage for whatever the morrow might bring.\n",
      "it  ----  long before he slept, however, and the discomfort of his position waked him frequently.\n",
      "he had not long to wait before the c ---- p was stirring.\n",
      "the man with the scarlet head band set about preparing a breakfast of boiled f ---- h.\n",
      "hugh’s guard of the night took h ----  gun and went away somewhere.\n",
      "breakfast was eaten at sunrise, and this time hugh’s hands  ----  unbound that he might feed himself, but he was left tied to the tree.\n",
      "it  ----  some time before the numbness wore off so that he could use his hands freely.\n",
      "his first attempts to manage his food  ---- used the indians, and the boy felt the blood rise to his cheeks at their grins and unintelligible gibes.\n",
      "breakfast  ----  over when the young fellow with the grin returned.\n",
      "he talked with ohrante, and afterwards the chief c ---- e over to hugh and began to ask questions.\n",
      "again the boy  ----  almost moved to mirth at the contrast between the giant’s appearance and his voice.\n",
      "as ohrante went on with h ----  questioning, however, hugh almost forgot the ludicrous voice.\n",
      "h ----  replies kept his wits busy.\n",
      "the iroquo ----  wanted to know whether hugh trapped for himself or traded with others for furs, whether he sold to the old company or to the new, where he intended to winter and other particulars.\n",
      "hugh had believed that he had his story well planned, but several of the questions  ----  unforeseen, and he was obliged to think quickly and invent as he replied.\n",
      "telling a false tale  ----  not such a simple matter this morning, and he was not at all sure that he made his convincing.\n",
      "after ohrante turned away, hugh  ----  left wondering if his answers had allayed the giant’s suspicions or aroused them.\n",
      "xxv the chief of minong hugh had expected to learn h ----  fate that morning and had braced himself for the ordeal, but ohrante paid no further attention to him.\n",
      "with six of his band the iroquois left the c ---- p.\n",
      "his wrists had been bound again and he  ----  tied to the tree.\n",
      "shortly after the canoe had disappe ---- d, both men went off somewhere out of sight and hearing.\n",
      "now  ----  his chance, thought hugh, if he could only find some way to loose his bonds.\n",
      "he pulled and wriggled and tw ---- ted, but to no avail.\n",
      "h ----  captors had done their work too well.\n",
      "h ----  struggles only drew the knots tighter.\n",
      "he sank back inert and d ---- heartened.\n",
      "“take heart.” the whisper  ----  so low hugh doubted his ears.\n",
      "he turned h ----  head.\n",
      "prone on the ground in the shadow of a willow lay a slim figure, the black head ra ---- ed ever so little.\n",

      "the guards  ----  too near.\n",

      "the two  ----  only a little way out in the bay.\n",
      "later i l ---- tened to them talk again.\n",
      "i could not get the meaning of all they said, but i think ohrante intends to hold a council on that  ---- land where he tortures his prisoners.\n",
      "i  ----  sure that others are to meet him there to join his band.” “and he was reserving me to be put to death by torture as a sort of entertainment for his new adherents, i suppose,” hugh muttered grimly.\n",
      "“that  ----  not the part in the performance i should choose to play.\n",
      "perhaps i can find some other part more to my liking.” a daring suggestion had come into his mind as blaise told of the council on the “island of torture.” “did you learn when the meeting  ----  to be?” hugh asked abruptly.\n",
      "“it  ----  to be soon, i think.\n",
      "they wait only for safe weather to make the crossing.” hugh  ----  silent in frowning thought.\n",
      "when he spoke, it  ----  not of the council.\n",
      "“it  ----  plain to see what happened,” he said musingly.\n",
      "“the storm bore father and h ----  comrade here to this island.\n",
      "their boat  ----  driven into that crack in the rocks and wrecked.\n",
      "ohrante c ---- e upon them, took them captive and carried them to the mainland.\n",
      "i wonder, blaise, if, when he  ----  first wrecked, he put the furs up on that rock shelf to keep them dry and safe.\n",
      "then, afterwards, when he learned ohrante  ----  near, he moved the bales to a more secret spot farther from the wreck.” blaise nodded.\n",
      "“it may be,”  ----  all he said.\n",
      "“we  ----  right all the time,” hugh added, “in believing that ohrante had something to do with father’s death.” “i felt in my heart that ohrante was the guilty one,” the younger lad replied simply.\n",
      "“yet of course it may not have been ohrante himself who gave father h ----  death blow,” hugh mused.\n",
      "bla ---- e waved away his brother’s reasoning with a gesture.\n",
      "“it matters not whether ohrante himself or one of h ----  men struck the blow.\n",
      "it  ----  not the knife that we punish when a murder is committed, but the man who wields the knife.\n",
      "ohrante  ----  that man.\n",
      "it  ----  he who captured our father, who would have put him to the torture, who caused his death.” “and ohrante shall pay for it,” hugh broke in passionately.\n",
      "the sky  ----  lighter, blaise,” he added, looking up above the surrounding tree tops.\n",
      "“we must be moving.” xxviii confusing the trail looking around for a tall tree, bla ---- e found a tapering spruce, growing in a pocket of deeper soil and towering above its fellows.\n",
      "the stubs of the lower branches, that, deprived of light by adjacent trees, had died and fallen off, formed a ladder, up which he clim ---- d, hugh not far behind.\n",
      "reaching the live limbs, they pushed their way  ---- ong the thick masses of dark green needles.\n",

      "beyond the slight dip, the r ---- ing ranks of trees betrayed the steepness of the ascent.\n",
      "a little to his right and far up, his keen eyes detected a b ----  stretch of rock between the masses of foliage above and below.\n",
      "hugh, learning from the movement of the branches above him that blaise  ----  descending, also moved farther down.\n",
      "there, resting on a stout limb, he waited for h ----  brother.\n",
      "“i could see that we  ----  part way up the ridges.\n",
      "have we kept a straight course?” “yes, we have come straighter than i fe ---- d, but we are scarce more than half-way up, and we must go farther to the left.\n",

      "the rapidly r ---- ing ground, interrupted by shallow depressions only, served as a guide.\n",
      "where the slope was regular and not too steep and there was soil enough to anchor them, trees grew thick, but abrupt b ----  places, masses of tumbled rocks and almost vertical walls made up much of the way.\n",

      "they  ----  no longer compelled to proceed by sense of feeling only.\n",
      "sound of wind, active of limb, and goaded on by the signs of breaking day, they clim ---- d swiftly and without pause.\n",
      "crossing a narrow shelf of broken rock débris, that had crumbled into soil deep enough to bear trees, they c ---- e to the last rise.\n",
      "by going farther to the left, they had thought to avoid the bare, pillared, rock r ---- parts, and had indeed escaped the steepest and highest stretch.\n",
      "nevertheless the cliff before them  ----  almost vertical, and clothed with only an occasional sturdy, dwarfed mass of cedar or trailing juniper, a little seedling tree, stunted bush or tiny plant, growing in crevice or hollow, and the ever present, tight clinging moss and lichens.\n",
      "had the ancient rock not  ----  ribbed and blocked and weathered, it would have been unclimbable.\n",
      "the splitting off of blocks and scaling away of flakes, which had crumbled into débr ----  at the foot of the cliff, had left shelves and crannies affording some foothold and finger-hold to the active climber.\n",
      "it  ----  a bad place to go up but not an impossible one.\n",

      "they w ---- hed their pursuers to see that they had taken to the water at this spot.\n",
      "their intention was to lead ohrante, should he find their trail, away from the island where the furs  ----  hidden.\n",
      "“wouldn’t it be possible, bla ---- e,” hugh questioned, “to load the furs and start across the lake at once?\n",
      "if the wind is right, i  ----  willing to risk ohrante’s seeing us and giving chase.\n",
      "with a good breeze we can outd ---- tance his canoes.” blaise shook his head.\n",
      "“we could not run away from him in th ----  wind.\n",
      "last night it  ----  nearly northeast, but now it is northwest.\n",
      "surely you noticed that when we  ----  on the ridge top.\n",
      "we cannot make speed with th ----  heavy bateau against the wind.\n",
      "yet it  ----  not too strong for canoes to go against it, if the men at the paddles have skill.\n",
      "now we will carry our false trail farther.” bla ---- e steered the boat straight across the channel to the outer end of the opposite island.\n",
      "between steep, high, b ----  masses of detached rock and the small island itself, a reef extended, the inner end rising out of the water to form a beach of boulders and pebbles.\n",
      "they could see off across the open water to the east, where the sun  ----  already above the horizon.\n",
      "“here,” said bla ---- e, “we will leave the ashes of a fire, as if we had stopped to cook a meal.\n",
      "make haste and get wood.” hugh did not need to  ----  warned to make haste.\n",
      "a small fire was soon kindled on the pebbles where it could not spread, then partly st ---- ped out and left smouldering.\n",
      "as the boys embarked again, hugh glanced back to satisfy himself that the wind  ----  not carrying any sparks towards the woods.\n",
      "heretofore he had always drenched his cooking fire before leaving c ---- p, but to have poured water on this one would have defeated his younger brother’s purpose.\n",
      "bla ---- e wanted the recent kindling of the fire to be in plain evidence.\n",
      "“they will find no tracks or signs on th ----  little island except around the fire.\n",
      "then they will  ----  sure we have gone by boat, but which way they will not know.” “which way shall we go?” hugh questioned.\n",
      "“back to our c ---- p in the little inland lake, but not down the channel next the point.\n",
      "we will steer around these big rocks and up the other side of th ----  island.” the two paddled the bateau around the rocks and up along the southeastern side of the small island.\n",
      "their route led them into the open end of the narrow strait that cut into the other island where the furs  ----  hidden.\n",
      "they passed the gap with its two tiny islets, where heretofore they had gone in and out, and  ----  soon back in the little pond.\n",
      "“i don’t know whether we  ----  wise to stay here,” hugh said thoughtfully, as they drew the boat up on the narrow beach.\n",
      "“we have tried to confuse our trail, yet if ohrante tracks us across the high ridge and down to the water, he will surely search all these  ---- lands.\n",
      "th ----  is almost too perfect a hiding place.\n",
      "if those indians are f ---- iliar with this ‘bay of spirits’ they will think of this place at once.\n",
      "then we shall be caught like rats in a trap.” “you  ----  right to call this the ‘bay of spirits,’” blaise replied.\n",
      "“by that n ---- e monga and red band spoke of it.\n",
      "but i think they have never  ----  here but that one time.\n",
      "from what they said i think they have always made their c ---- ps on the part of minong that lies the other side of the high ridge.\n",
      "and now both monga and red band have great fear of th ----  bay.” hugh chuckled.\n",
      "i saw h ----  fear in his face when i spoke of hearing strange noises.\n",
      "i  ----  wondering, though, if he should track us here, if he will not suspect a trick.” “something more than the voices has frightened them,” blaise went on.\n",
      "“the second time i l ---- tened to those two, monga told red band of huge giants at the end of the point.” “giants?\n",
      "did he mean those pillars of rock?” “no, the giants  ----  alive and moved.” “some old superstition, blaise.” “monga said he saw the giants, hugh, he and others of the band.” “we spent nearly a day on that point and we saw no giants.\n",
      "if monga saw anything there it must have  ----  you and me.\n",
      "i don’t understand how those fellows in that canoe could have m ---- sed seeing us.\n",
      "blaise,”—a sudden light of understanding dawned in hugh’s face,—“blaise, do you remember how hot and still it  ---- , and how the haze shimmered on the water?\n",
      "and do you recall the day we crossed to the isle royale, the very s ---- e sort of day?\n",
      "we saw the mirage, high mountains towering up where later we found there  ----  no real mountains.\n",
      "do you remember too when we left the bay of the beaver, how we saw coming towards us through the morning mist, what we thought was a ship, so tall it looked, but when it drew ne ---- r it shrank to a mere sailboat?” “i remember those things.” blaise was staring at hugh’s excited face.\n",
      "don’t you see how it  ----  that monga and those others in that canoe saw giants on the end of the point?\n",
      "on that hot, still day, as they c ---- e across the water and looked through the shimmer of the heat haze, they saw us there on the open rocks.\n",
      "we ourselves saw that island far out greater than it really  ----  and distorted.\n",
      "do you remem ---- r how it shrank afterwards?\n",
      "to those men in that canoe we too  ----  distorted and loomed up huge and tall like giants.\n",
      "that  ----  what frightened them.\n",
      "we  ----  the giants on the end of the point!” blaise was still staring, but his look of puzzlement had given way to one almost of awe.\n",
      "“it may  ----  as you say,” he replied slowly.\n",
      "“monga thought it  ----  kepoochikan and nanibozho.\n",
      "i cannot understand it at all, that enchantment you call mirage that makes men see mountains that  ----  not there and turns bateaus into ships and men into giants.” “i don’t understand it either,” hugh admitted, “and neither did the captain of the _athabasca_.\n",
      "he said it  ----  just one of the secrets of nature that we don’t understand yet.\n",
      "surely the mirage  ----  nothing to fear.\n",
      "it has stood us in good stead by frightening away ohrante’s men and causing them to stand in terror of th ----  bay.\n",
      "no wonder we sc ---- d them away with the echoes.\n",
      "they must have been frightened when they c ---- e in here.\n",
      "if only their fear is strong enough to keep them away now, we  ----  safe.\n",
      "but we d ----  not trust too much to that.\n",
      "the entrance to th ----  little lake is narrow and i think i see a way to block it so it will look as if no boat could have gone through.\n",
      "first, though, let us eat something if there  ----  anything left.” “there is a little corn, if no animal has stolen it,” blaise replied.\n",
      "“i too  ----  sore hungry, for i have eaten nothing but a few green bearberries since i set out in search of you.” xxix the cedar barrier the corn, in its bark wrapping, was found untouched, hanging from the birch where blaise had left it.\n",
      "not daring to kindle a fire for fear the smoke might  ---- tray them, hugh put the dry, hulled kernels in the kettle with cold water to soften them.\n",
      "then he spoke again of h ----  plan to block the entrance to the pond.\n",
      "“that cedar that leans far down over the water,” he explained, “looks as if it  ----  almost ready to fall of its own weight.\n",
      "if we could pull or push it down, it would go clear across that narrow channel.” “but then we could not take our bateau through.” “oh, we can easily chop out a section when we  ----  ready to go.” “if anyone is near he will hear the sound of the axe.” “it is better to risk that, blaise, than to leave the entrance open.\n",
      "we will go look at the tree and see what we can do.” the leaning, top-heavy cedar had tipped so far that several of its roots had pulled loose from their anchorage, bringing with them a section of the shallow soil and exposing the rock  ---- low.\n",
      "on one side the roots still held, supplying enough nour ---- hment to the limbs to keep part of them alive.\n",
      "some of the thick sprays of foliage  ----  brown and dead, but many were still green and flourishing.\n",
      " ---- fore testing it, the boys noted where it would fall.\n",
      "“fresh breaks in other trees or bushes would  ---- tray how recently it had fallen.\n",
      "of course the fact that it  ----  partly green will prove it hasn’t been down very long.” “an uprooted tree lying in the water will stay green for many days,” blaise replied.\n",
      "“i think we had  ---- tter try to push it over,” hugh decided.\n",
      "th ----  end will be high enough from the water so, by cutting off a few of the lower limbs, we can take the boat underneath.” “if the water is deep enough at this side,” added blaise.\n",
      "it was not so insecure as it appe ---- d.\n",
      "the tough roots that still held  ----  stronger anchors than the boys had suspected.\n",
      "“we must cut away some of the roots that  ----  holding,” hugh said at last.\n",
      "“lend me your hatchet, bla ---- e.\n",
      "ohrante has mine.” the roots  ----  tough, but the little axe was sharp and hugh’s blows vigorous.\n",
      "here, bla ---- e.” hugh returned the hatchet, jumped upon the leaning trunk and made his way along it.\n",
      "as he went farther up and out, the strain on the few roots  ----  too great.\n",
      "hugh had expected the tree to go suddenly, and he kept a firm hold, but he  ----  jarred and drenched in the splash.\n",
      "the trunk, where he was clinging, did not go under water, and he scr ---- bled quickly back to shore.\n",
      "all the roots  ----  in the air now, and the tree slanted down from the butt, instead of up.\n",
      "the entrance to the little pond  ----  both well closed and effectually concealed.\n",
      "hugh uttered a little excl ---- ation of satisfaction.\n",
      "“it must look from out there,” he said, nodding towards the water  ---- yond, “like a perfectly natural accident.\n",
      "th ----  old cedar is the best of screens.\n",
      "i don’t believe anyone coming around that little island and seeing this fallen tree would guess there  ----  a lake or bay in here.\n",
      "of course if he c ---- e so close he could peep through the branches, he might be able to see water beyond, but he would never guess that a boat could go in.\n",
      "if anyone c ---- e up here, though, he would see the freshly upturned earth and the cut ends of the tree roots.\n",
      "but the bushes hide th ----  spot from the water and there is nothing to bring anyone ashore here.\n",
      "we shall be better hidden than we could have hoped.” “yes, it  ----  a good thought, my brother.\n",
      "we will go back now and bring the bateau around to th ----  side of the little lake.\n",
      "then if anyone looks through the branches and sees the water  ---- yond, he cannot see the bateau or us.\n",
      "if he tries to cut a way through, we shall hear him and  ----  warned.\n",
      "we must make haste.” without pausing to reply, hugh led off at once, back to the  ---- ach and around to the spot where the boat lay.\n",
      "quickly and carefully, the brothers erased all signs of their c ---- p that might be seen from across the pond.\n",
      "hugh gathered up the remains of the fire and  ----  about to throw them into the water, when blaise stopped him.\n",
      "the charred sticks might float across, and betray that someone had c ---- ped there.\n",
      "so hugh carried the blackened bits back into the woods, and then  ---- hed every trace of ashes from the pebbles and sand.\n",
      "the mast and sail, which had been left on shore,  ----  laid in the boat, and the lads paddled around to a spot less than a hundred feet from the end of the blockaded passageway.\n",
      "with the poplar rollers they had used  ---- fore, they drew the bateau up on shore, where it could not be seen by anyone peeping through the barrier.\n",
      "the sun would soon  ----  directly overhead.\n",
      "the boy did not believe that the iroquo ----  would let him escape without some effort to trace and recapture him.\n",
      "even now the chief of minong or some of h ----  followers might be near at hand.\n",
      "it would be w ---- e to lie low and keep very quiet, restricting conversation to necessary whispers.\n",
      "after chewing, as well as he could, some of the partly softened corn, hugh stretched himself out on the narrow beach to let the sun dry h ----  clothes.\n",
      "after what seemed a long period of inaction, he raised himself on his elbow and hitched ne ---- r his younger brother.\n",
      "the latter was sitting close to the bateau, his eyes closed, app ---- ntly asleep.\n",
      "“bla ---- e, i’m going up through the woods to find some spot where i can see out.\n",
      "then if anyone comes near our barrier i shall know it.” the half-breed boy had opened h ----  eyes at the first word.\n",
      "“we must take great c ---- ,” he replied in the softest of whispers.\n",
      "“the cracking of a twig, the moving of a bush may  ---- tray us.\n",
      "yet i  ----  ready to take the risk if you are.” “we’ll both go then, and we’ll not take more risk than we can help.” blaise nodded and rose.\n",
      "slipping into the woods just beyond where the boat lay, he threaded his way  ---- ong trees and bushes.\n",
      "it  ----  but a short distance, and after a few steps blaise dropped to his hands and knees.\n",
      "hugh followed his ex ---- ple, and remained motionless while the other crept ahead and disappeared behind a clump of balsams.\n",
      "beyond the bals ---- s he paused, but could catch no glimpse of blaise among the dense growth.\n",
      "the sunlight  ---- tween the trees ahead showed him that he must be close to the margin of the woods.\n",
      "for a moment he lay still, looking and l ---- tening.\n",
      "then he crept forward again and took h ----  station behind a thick mass of cedar needles.\n",
      "in its youth th ----  cedar had been bent almost double by some weight, a fallen tree probably, and had grown in that misshapen form, branching and leafing out in dense sprays clear to the ground.\n",
      "peeping around the green screen, hugh found he  ----  but a few feet from the edge of the water.\n",
      "the sheltered bay  ----  without a ripple, the sun hot, the woods still, the silence unbroken by even the twitter of a bird or the hum of an insect.\n",
      "the boy was about to raise himself for a better view, when, from the water, a sound c ---- e to his ears.\n",
      "the very slightest of sounds it was, but he lo ---- d his head instantly.\n",
      "he wriggled a little farther back  ---- hind the cedar masses and lay motionless.\n",
      "the sound c ---- e again, the slightest suggestion of rippling water.\n",
      "but the bay  ----  smooth and still.\n",
      "what he heard  ----  the dipping of a paddle blade, the ripple of water against the side of a boat.\n",
      "for a few moments hugh d ---- d not try to look.\n",
      "then curiosity got the  ---- tter of fear.\n",
      "ra ---- ing his head ever so little, he found a peep-hole between the cedar sprays and put his eye to it.\n",
      "he could see a bit of the round, wooded  ---- let, a section of the shore opposite and, on the water between, a birch canoe.\n",
      "the bow-man  ----  the tall young iroquois who had first taken hugh prisoner.\n",
      "the man in the middle wore a red band about h ----  long black hair.\n",
      "as the canoe c ---- e nearer, hugh could see that the steersman was the squat ojibwa from whose custody he had escaped.\n",
      "ohrante had not killed the guard then, but no doubt some heavy pun ---- hment hung over monga’s head if he did not find hugh and bring him back.\n",
      "he was desperate enough to d ----  return to the dreaded bay of manitos.\n",
      "the canoe c ---- e slowly, the man in the bow watching the water.\n",
      "it  ----  shallow between the round islet and the blocked entrance to the little pond.\n",
      "hugh held h ----  breath.\n",
      "red band’s eyes  ----  on his paddle.\n",
      "monga’s head turned from side to side, as he scanned the shore and the woods for any sign that the fugitive had  ----  there.\n",
      "h ----  glance swept the barrier.\n",
      "he tw ---- ted his paddle.\n",
      "the canoe swerved ne ---- r to the blocked passage.\n",
      "the man in the bow uttered a sharp h ---- s of warning.\n",
      "for an instant hugh fe ---- d that the fellow had caught sight of him through the leafy screen.\n",
      "but the warning  ----  of shallows ahead.\n",
      "the steersman dipped h ----  paddle and swerved the canoe again, this time away from the fallen cedar.\n",
      "he did not cast another glance in that direction, as the canoe c ---- e on past the barrier.\n",

      "the water  ----  at its lowest point of fluctuation.\n",
      "it  ----  plain that the indians intended to round the little islet.\n",
      "to do so they must pass close to the shore where hugh  ---- .\n",
      "he lo ---- d his head cautiously and lay prone and motionless.\n",
      "in an instant he realized that the voice was monga’s and that it c ---- e from the water, not from the land.\n",
      "the tall fellow ans ---- d briefly, and monga grunted an abrupt rejoinder.\n",
      "hugh drew a long breath, ra ---- ed his head a little and looked through the peep-hole.\n",
      "the canoe  ----  no longer in sight.\n",
      "it could not  ----  far away, though, so he lay still.\n",
      "he  ----  just wondering whether it would be safe now to try for another and wider view of the bay and strait, and had raised his head to reconnoiter, when he caught sight of a crouching figure slipping swiftly between the trees towards him.\n",

      "“but you and i, as our father’s sons, will claim the right to deal with him.” there  ----  a hard, fierce note in the lad’s voice.\n",
      "jean beaupré had not been a mild man, yet it  ----  not so much the hot-tempered french father that spoke now in the son, as the fierce, implacable savage.\n",
      "bitterly as hugh hated the giant mohawk, he sensed something different and alien in h ----  half-brother’s passion.\n",
      "through the weeks of constant association with blaise, hugh had ceased ordinarily to think of him as indian, but now, for the moment, he  ----  not blaise beaupré, but attekonse, ojibwa.\n",
      "yet it  ----  the white boy who was the most impatient at the thought of delay in dealing with ohrante.\n",
      "the wind, however, had app ---- ntly settled the question.\n",
      "the breeze would carry the boat northwest to thunder bay, but would  ----  more hindrance than help in going southwest to grand portage.\n",
      "in the lee of an  ---- land, the brothers raised their mast and ran up their sail.\n",
      "as they paddled out from shelter, the breeze caught the canvas and they  ----  off across the lake.\n",
      "clouds had covered the moon, and it  ----  too dark to sight thunder cape.\n",
      "the boys could do nothing but run  ---- fore the wind and trust to it to carry them somewhere near their destination.\n",
      "at any rate they  ----  leaving minong and putting the miles between themselves and the cruel, self-appointed chief of the island.\n",
      "that wonderful and beautiful island, which the white men had appropriately called royale, deserved a better king, and the first step in the right direction  ----  to depose the present usurper, thought hugh with grim humor.\n",
      "as they went farther out, however, the wind increased, and before long they laid aside the blades, satisfied that they  ----  making fairly good progress.\n",
      "to the south and east, the sky  ----  banked with masses of cloud.\n",
      "a rain-storm coming down upon the heavily loaded, open bateau would be unpleasant if not d ---- astrous.\n",
      "from the behavior of the sail, he knew that the wind  ----  less steady.\n",
      "during the past two months he had learned something of the moods of lake superior, and he understood that he must  ----  ready for a sudden shift.\n",
      "he had been handling both sheet and tiller, but now he turned the steering over to h ----  brother.\n",
      "the change of wind c ---- e suddenly and with force.\n",
      "for a few moments hugh had h ----  hands full.\n",
      "blaise obeyed orders on the instant, sail and boat  ----  swung about, and were soon running freely before the wind again.\n",
      "“we may not reach the k ---- inistikwia so soon as we hoped,” hugh commented, when the momentary danger was past.\n",
      "“the wind seems to  ----  taking us where it chooses.\n",
      "as near as i can tell we must be running almost directly west now instead of northwest.” bla ---- e looked up at the only patch of clear sky visible.\n",
      "if the wind holds steady we shall reach the shore somewhere between the k ---- inistikwia and the grand portage.\n",
      "even that would be a better fate than falling into ohrante’s hands.” the breeze  ----  increasing in force, the waves running ever higher.\n",
      "hugh and blaise  ----  kept busy and alert.\n",
      "before the wind, the bateau was sailing swiftly enough so that there was little danger of following seas actually sw ---- ping it, but, heavily laden, it rode low, with little buoyancy.\n",
      "those  ----  the dangerous moments.\n",
      "with the utmost c ----  in handling sail and rudder, the brothers could do little to insure against disaster.\n",
      "to keep straight before the wind, not to lose control of sail or rudder, and to take the chances with coolness and composure  ----  about all there was to do.\n",
      "as they drove on in the darkness, now riding high on the summit of a wave, now pitching down  ---- tween walls of water, they lost all count of time.\n",
      "the waves seemed to  ----  flattening out a little.\n",
      "surely they  ----  less high and long, yet they were even more troublesome, for they had grown choppy and uneven.\n",
      "when bla ---- e steered straight with them, hugh found the sail swinging around.\n",
      "when he sailed directly  ---- fore the wind, the boat pitched at an angle with the waves.\n",
      "“it comes from the northeast now,” bla ---- e returned.\n",
      "both  ----  too busy and anxious to talk.\n",
      "hugh confined h ----  speech to sharply given orders and blaise to answering grunts.\n",
      "the boat  ----  shipping a good deal of water, but bailing was impossible.\n",
      "the elder brother had his hands full with the sail, the younger  ----  compelled to give all his attention to steering.\n",
      "the wind steadied and the waves o ---- yed it.\n",
      "once more the bateau could ride them straight, while running directly  ---- fore the breeze.\n",
      "the clouds  ----  broken now, moving swiftly across the sky, covering and uncovering the moon and stars.\n",
      "whenever the boys d ---- d to take their eyes from sail and water, they glanced upward.\n",
      "when enough sky had been blown clean to show them the position of the moon and principal stars, both lads were surprised to learn that dawn was not ne ---- r.\n",
      "it seemed to them that they had been pitching about in the waves for a very long time, yet the day  ----  still hours away.\n",
      "the wind continued strong, the waves  ----  higher than ever, but the brothers had gained more confidence in the sailing qualities of the boat and in their own ability to handle it.\n",
      "less water  ----  being shipped, and by bailing when they had a chance, they managed to keep it from rising too high.\n",
      "now that the sky  ----  clearing and there was more light on the lake, they could see farther across it.\n",
      "as the boat rose to the top of a wave, bla ---- e said suddenly, “l’isle du paté.” hugh looked quickly and, before the bateau pitched down between the waves, he caught a glimpse of a compact, abrupt, black mass towering from the water not many miles to his right.\n",
      "there seemed to be no chance of reaching the mouth of the k ---- inistikwia though.\n",
      "to turn and run in past the south side of pie island  ----  out of the question.\n",
      "the square sail would be worse than useless, and the laden bateau would inevitably be sw ---- ped in the trough of the waves.\n",
      "the stars  ----  waning in the paling sky.\n",
      "the short summer night  ----  drawing to a close and dawn was approaching.\n",
      "south and west of pie island and ne ---- r at hand, lower lines of shore appeared, the chain of islands from one of which the adventurers had set out for the isle royale.\n",
      "those islands, across several miles of heaving water,  ----  still too far away to be reached.\n",
      "wind and waves  ----  carrying the bateau by.\n",
      "the sun, coming up in an almost clear sky, found the boat still running southwest on a course almost parallel with the unattainable chain of  ---- lands.\n",
      "as the hours passed, the boys were encouraged to discover that they were drawing gradually ne ---- r and nearer to the islands on the right.\n",
      "what was still better, they  ----  bearing straight towards land ahead, continuous, high land they knew must be the main shore.\n",
      "it seemed that they must reach the mainland not many miles to the southwest of the place where the chain of  ---- lands diverged from it.\n",
      "hugh had long since ceased to be particular where he landed, if it  ----  only in some spot where food might be obtained.\n",
      "rations the day before had been very scanty, and he  ----  exceedingly hungry.\n",
      "the wind  ----  strong but steady, the waves long and high.\n",
      "the bateau, as it plunged down into the trough, continued to ship a little water, but the boys kept it down by bailing when a hand and arm could be sp ---- d.\n",
      "they were borne ne ---- r and nearer to the land.\n",
      "as they ran past a group of small  ---- lets not more than a half mile distant, with a larger and higher island showing beyond them, hugh glanced that way and considered trying to turn.\n",
      "bla ---- e guessed his brother’s thought.\n",
      "“the mainland  ----  not far now,” he said, “and we go straight towards it.\n",
      "there will  ----  more chance to find food on the mainland also.” both of the younger boy’s arguments had weight with hugh.\n",
      "at the end of another hour they  ----  bearing down upon an irregular, rocky point.\n",
      "“ ----  that island or mainland, do you think?” hugh inquired.\n",
      "“mainland,”  ----  the unhesitating reply.\n",
      "“i remem ---- r the place.\n",
      "he himself must have passed that spot twice within two months, but there  ----  so many rocky points along the shore.\n",
      "hugh  ----  observing enough in the white man’s way, but he did not see how blaise could remember all those places and tell them apart.\n",
      "when a bay c ---- e into view, hugh expected blaise to steer in, but the latter made no move to do so.\n",
      "“it  ----  steep and rocky there,” he explained, with a nod towards the abrupt-shored cove.\n",
      "“beyond yet a little way  ----  a better place, shallow and well protected.” past another point and along a steep rock shore they sailed.\n",
      "here they  ----  in much calmer water, for the points broke the force of wind and waves.\n",
      "as they approached a group of small  ---- lands, blaise remarked, “it is best to take down the sail.\n",
      "we can paddle in.” accordingly hugh lowered the sail and took up his paddle, while blaise steered the bateau in  ---- ong the islets.\n",
      "in a few moments the haven lay revealed, an almost round bay, its entrance nearly closed by  ---- lets.\n",
      "the islands and the points on either side were rocky, but the shores of the bay were low and densely wooded with t ---- arack, cedar and black spruce.\n",
      "the water  ----  almost calm, and the boys made a landing on a bit of beach on the inner side and under the high land of the right hand point.\n",
      "hugh had not realized that he  ----  particularly tired.\n",
      "now, suddenly, an overpowering weariness and weakness c ---- e over him.\n",
      "h ----  legs almost collapsed under him.\n",
      "he dropped down on the  ---- ach, too utterly exhausted to move.\n",
      "he  ----  on solid land again, but he could scarcely realize it.\n",
      "his head  ----  dizzy, and the moment his eyes closed he seemed to be heaving up and down again.\n",
      "xxxii the fire at the end of the trail when hugh woke, the dizziness and sense of swaying up and down  ----  gone.\n",
      "the bateau  ----  drawn up on the beach, but blaise was nowhere in sight.\n",
      "from the shadows hugh could tell that the sun  ----  on its downward journey.\n",
      "he  ----  just gathering up his courage to get up, when he heard a stone rattling down the rock hill behind him.\n",
      "turning h ----  head, he saw blaise descending.\n",
      "the boy  ----  carrying several fish strung on a withe.\n",
      "hugh eyed those f ---- h with hungry eyes.\n",
      "he got to h ----  feet and looked around for fuel.\n",
      "not until he had a fire kindled, and,—too impatient to let it burn down to coals or to wait for water to heat,— ----  holding a piece of fish on a crotched stick before the blaze, did he ask his younger brother where he had been.\n",
      "“i slept for a while,” bla ---- e admitted, “but not for long.\n",
      "my hunger  ----  too great.\n",
      "i took my gun and my line and clim ---- d to the top of the point.\n",
      "i went along the steep cliff, but i found no g ---- e and no tracks.\n",

      "we can surely find others at the portage willing to go with us against ohrante.” “it  ----  all we can do,” blaise assented, “unless we wait here for the wind to change.\n",
      "it  ----  almost from the north now.\n",
      "“why not try fishing  ---- ong those little islands?” the channels among the islets proved good fishing ground.\n",
      "sailing  ----  out of the question, and paddling the laden bateau would be slow work, but hugh was too impatient to delay longer, and blaise more than willing to go on.\n",
      "“we are not far from the rivière aux tourtres now.” he used the french n ---- e for the pigeon river, a name which seems to mean “river of turtles.” the word _tourtres_ doubtless referred to turtle doves or pigeons.\n",
      "“to paddle th ----  bateau,” blaise went on, “is very slow, and to reach wauswaugoning by water we must go far out into the waves around that long point below the river mouth.\n",
      "but along the south bank of the river  ----  an ojibwa trail.\n",
      "at a  ---- nd the trail leaves the river and goes on across the point to wauswaugoning.\n",
      "we shall save time if we go that way, by land.” “what about the boat and the furs?” “we will leave them  ---- hind.\n",

      "again and again he said to take them to the new company at the k ---- inistikwia.\n",
      "there  ----  some trouble between them, i know not what.” blaise was usually willing to yield to his elder brother’s judgment, but this time he proved obstinate.\n",

      "the cache completed, bla ---- e led hugh to the opening of the trail at the river mouth.\n",
      "the trail, the boy said, had been used by the ojib ----  for many years.\n",
      "a narrow, rough, but d ---- tinct path had been trodden by the many moccasined feet that had travelled over it.\n",
      "the moonlight filtered through the trees, and bla ---- e, who had been that way before, followed the track readily.\n",
      "with them the brothers carried the remaining blanket, the gun,  ---- munition, kettle and the rest of their fish.\n",
      "as blaise had said, the trail ran along the south bank until a bend was reached, then, leaving the river, went on in the s ---- e westerly direction across the point of land between the mouth of the pigeon river and wauswaugoning bay.\n",
      "the whole distance  ----  not more than three miles, and the boys made good time.\n",

      "we need not fear, but because of the white man, we will say nothing of the furs.” the two went forward almost noiselessly, but, in spite of their quiet approach, when they c ---- e out of the woods by the fire, one of the indians woke and sat up.\n",
      "“bo-jou,” remarked bla ---- e.\n",
      "the second indian  ----  awake now.\n",
      "the white man rolled over, but  ---- fore he could speak, hugh sprang towards him with a cry of pleasure.\n",
      "“bapt ---- te, it is good to see you!\n",
      "how come you here?” “eh lá, hugh beaupré, and i might ask that of you yourself,” returned the aston ---- hed frenchman.\n",
      "when i said you  ----  with your brother attekonse, one man remembered seeing him with a white man.\n",
      "that  ----  all i could learn.\n",
      "i  ----  sore afraid some evil had befallen you.\n",
      "you  ----  long in returning to the sault.” “yes,” hugh replied with some hesitation.\n",
      " ----  the _otter_ at the grand portage, baptiste?” “no, she has returned to the new fort.\n",
      "i c ---- e on her to the grand portage.\n",
      "there was a man at the portage, a canadian like myself, who wanted sorely to go to the k ---- inistikwia.\n",
      "he has wife and child there, and the mate of the sloop brought him word that the child  ----  very sick.\n",
      "so as i have neither wife nor child and  ----  in no haste, i let him have my place.\n",
      "now i  ----  returning by canoe, with manihik and keneu here.” at the mention of their names, the two indians nodded gravely towards hugh and repeated their “bo-jou, bo-jou.” “we camp here until the wind goes down,” baptiste concluded.\n",
      "during the frenchman’s explanation, hugh had been doing some rapid thinking and had come to a dec ---- ion.\n",
      "he knew bapt ---- te for a simple, honest, true-hearted fellow.\n",
      "in one of h ----  indian companions blaise had already expressed confidence.\n",
      "“baptiste,” hugh asked abruptly, “have you ever heard of ohrante, the iroquois hunter?” there  ----  a fierce grunt from one of the indians.\n",
      "the black eyes of both  ----  fixed on hugh.\n",
      "“truly i have,” bapt ---- te replied promptly.\n",
      "“as great a villain as ever went unhanged.” “would you like to help get him hanged?” keneu sprang to h ----  feet.\n",
      "it  ----  evident he had understood something of what hugh had said.\n",
      "“where  ----  the iroquois wolf?” “there is an island down the shore,” hugh went on, “the island of torture, ohrante calls it, where he and his band take their prisoners and torture them to death.\n",
      "sometime soon he  ----  to hold a sort of council there.” “how know you that?” baptiste interrupted.\n",
      "“i shall have to tell you the whole story.” hugh turned to h ----  half-brother.\n",
      "“bla ---- e, shall we tell them all?\n",
      "baptiste i can trust, i know.” “as you think best, my brother.” sitting on a log by the fire at the edge of the woods, while the moonlight flooded the bay beyond, hugh related his strange tale to the  ---- azed and excited canadian and the intent, fierce-eyed keneu, the “war eagle.” the other indian also watched and listened, but it was evident from his face that he understood little or nothing of what was said.\n",
      "frankly he told the story of the search for the hidden furs, the encounters with ohrante and h ----  band, the capture and escape, and what blaise had learned from overhearing the conversations between monga and the indian with the red head band.\n",
      "hugh did not mention, however, the packet he carried under h ----  shirt, nor did he say definitely where he and blaise had left the bateau and the furs.\n",
      "those details  ----  not essential to the story, and might as well be omitted.\n",
      "“we know now it  ----  through ohrante father was killed,” the boy concluded, “and we, blaise and i, intend that the iroquois shall pay the penalty for his crime.\n",
      "he has other evil deeds to pay for as well, and that  ---- n’t all.\n",
      "as long as he  ----  at liberty, he is a menace to white man and peaceable indian alike.\n",
      "he calls himself chief of minong, and he has an  ---- bition to be a sort of savage king.\n",
      "he  ----  swollen with vanity and belief in his own greatness, and he seems to be a natural leader of men, with a sort of uncanny influence over those he draws about him.\n",
      "one moment you think him ridiculous, but the next you  ----  not sure he is not a great man.\n",
      "if he succeeds in gathering a really strong band he can do serious harm.” keneu gave a grunt of assent, and bapt ---- te nodded emphatically.\n",
      "“he must  ----  taken,” the latter said.\n",
      "“taken or destroyed, like the wolf he  ---- ,” hugh replied grimly.\n",
      "“we have a plan, bla ---- e and i.” for nearly an hour longer, the five sat by the fire discussing, in english, french and ojibwa, hugh’s plan.\n",
      "then, a dec ---- ion reached, each rolled himself in his blanket for a few hours’ sleep.\n",
      "xxxiii the capture of monga baptiste’s canoe was large enough to accommodate hugh and blaise, and the party  ----  up and away early.\n",
      "the lake  ----  no longer rough, so they made good time through wauswaugoning bay and around the point to the grand portage.\n",
      "though baptiste had been employed, in one capacity or another, by the old northwest company, he  ----  under no contract.\n",
      "an independent spirited fellow, who c ---- e and went much as he pleased, he did not feel under any obligation to the old company and was not an ardent partisan of that organization, so he made no objection when hugh proposed that they try the x y post for help in their undertaking.\n",
      "the men of either company would be glad no doubt to lay hands on the rascally iroquois but the x y men’s grievance  ----  the stronger, since ohrante had been in the employ of the old company when he committed his first crime.\n",
      "the white man he had slain  ----  an independent trapper, affiliated with neither company, but jean beaupré had been under contract, for the one season at least, to the new company.\n",
      "to learn that he too had come to his death through the giant mohawk would add fuel to the fl ---- e of the x y men’s anger.\n",
      "at the post hugh and blaise told as much of their story as  ----  essential to prove that they had really encountered ohrante, had learned his plans and knew where to lay hands on him.\n",
      "the time for the annual meeting of the new northwest company, still held at the grand portage post,  ----  approaching.\n",
      "none of the partners or leading men had yet arrived, but most of the northmen, as the men who wintered inland west of the lake,  ----  called, had come with their furs, and a considerable number of indians were gathered at the post.\n",
      "it would not do to approach the  ---- land of torture in too great force.\n",
      "hugh and blaise, with baptiste and the two indians,  ----  to go first, find out whether ohrante’s recruits had assembled and watch for the coming of the chief himself.\n",
      "hugh had a very simple plan, which prom ---- ed to be effective, to prevent ohrante from leaving his council island before the grand portage party arrived.\n",
      "the plan of c ---- paign arranged, the scouts got under way at once.\n",
      "it  ----  headed straight for the land, but suddenly swung about and turned down shore.\n",
      "blaise, who  ----  second from the bow, raised his paddle for a moment, while he gazed intently at the other canoe.\n",
      "turning h ----  head, he called back to hugh and baptiste, “red band!\n",
      "it  ----  red band and i think monga.” “_vite!_ make speed!” ordered baptiste.\n",
      "keneu, in the bow, had already quickened h ----  powerful stroke.\n",
      "the others followed h ----  lead and the five blades dipped and rose with vigorous, rapid rhythm.\n",
      "the indians ahead did their best, bending to their paddles with desperate energy, but their canoe was fully as large as baptiste’s and they  ----  two paddles to five.\n",
      "keneu saw in an instant what the two men  ----  trying to do.\n",
      "they intended to  ---- ach their boat and take to the woods, trusting to lose their pursuers in the thick growth.\n",
      "bapt ---- te’s canoe swung in towards shore.\n",
      "it must cut off the fugitives, get  ---- tween them and the land.\n",
      "the shore  ----  steep and rocky, and there was no good place to beach a boat.\n",
      "yet so great  ----  the panic of monga and red band that they kept straight on.\n",
      "despairing of escape by water, they  ----  ready to smash their canoe on the rocks and take a chance of reaching land.\n",
      "their canoe struck full on the jagged edge of a rock just  ---- low the surface.\n",
      "the pursuers  ----  close enough to hear the ripping sound, as the sharp rock tore a great gash in the thin bark.\n",
      "red band sprang from the bow, but monga remained where he  ----  in the stern, the canoe settling under him.\n",
      "the pursuers  ---- nt to their paddles and shot towards the wrecked boat.\n",
      "they reached the spot just as monga  ----  going down, but they did not intend to let him escape them by drowning.\n",

      "the brothers  ----  now but a short distance from the canoes.\n",
      "the chief peril  ----  that someone might be guarding the boats.\n",
      "blaise drew his knife from the sheath and c ---- fully, without a sound of ripping, cut a great hole in the bark, removing a section between the ribs.\n",
      "it began to fill immediately, the water entering the big hole with only a slight gurgling no ---- e.\n",
      "they  ---- at a hasty retreat and lay close under the alders.\n",
      "the indians around the fire, however,  ----  too engrossed in their own affairs to heed the sound, if indeed it carried that far.\n",
      "a man with a full, deep voice  ----  speaking at length, his tones reaching the boys where they lay hidden.\n",
      "every now and then h ----  listeners broke in with little grunts and ejaculations of approval or assent.\n",
      "a crash of thunder, following close upon a bright flash, drowned h ----  voice.\n",
      "when the rumbling ceased, he  ----  no longer speaking.\n",
      "something else  ----  happening now.\n",
      "little cries and grunts, accompanied by the beating together of wood and metal and the click of rattles in rude rhythm, c ---- e to the boys’ ears.\n",
      "“they  ----  dancing,” thought hugh.\n",
      "ohrante  ----  certainly insane or very sure he is invincible.\n",
      "it  ----  time we finished our work.” he missed blaise from his side, and crept down to the remaining canoe, supposing his younger brother had gone that way.\n",
      "blaise  ----  not there.\n",
      "hugh waited several minutes, listening to the grunts and cries, which, low voiced at first,  ----  growing louder and faster as the dancers warmed to their work.\n",
      "suddenly one of them uttered a yell, which  ----  followed by quite a different sound, an animal’s bellow of rage or pain.\n",
      "hugh  ----  both alarmed and curious.\n",
      "what  ----  going on up there, and what had become of blaise?\n",
      "the elder brother crept back across the pebbles, pushed his way cautiously  ---- ong the alders, and crawled up a short, steep slope topped by more bushes and trees, through which the firelight flickered.\n",
      "the no ---- es of the dance, broken by louder cries and angry bellows, continued.\n",
      "in the open space a big fire blazed, casting its reddish-yellow gl ----  over the picture.\n",
      "between the fire and the boy, the dancing figures of the indians passed back and forth, crouching, st ---- ping, gesticulating, to the rhythm of their hoarse cries and the clicking of their weapons and rattles.\n",
      "all  ----  naked to the waist and some entirely so.\n",
      "their faces and bodies  ----  streaked and daubed with black and white, yellow and red.\n",
      "near by, in dignified immobility, stood the self-styled chief of minong, h ----  tall feather upright in his head band, his face and breast fantastically painted in black and vermilion.\n",
      "his bronze body  ----  stripped to the waist, displaying to advantage the breadth of his shoulders and the great muscles of his long arms.\n",
      "a little shudder passed down hugh’s spine as h ----  eyes rested upon that huge, towering form and the set, cruel face.\n",
      "yet it  ----  neither the war dance nor ohrante that held his surprised gaze longest.\n",
      "to its white stem  ----  tied, not a human victim this time, but the dark form of an animal, a moose.\n",
      "as the  ---- ast tossed its head about in frenzy, hugh could see that its antlers, still covered with the fuzzy velvet, had no broad palms and bore but two points on either side.\n",
      "it  ----  a crotch horn or two year old.\n",
      "a favorite sport seemed to  ----  to strike the beast upon the sensitive end of the nose with a burning pole.\n",
      "the moose  ----  wild with rage and pain, plunging madly about, swaying the birch almost to breaking.\n",
      "the bonds  ----  strong and the tree failed to snap, yet the boy wondered how long it would be before something gave and freed the frenzied beast.\n",
      "he thought the young moose did not realize h ----  own strength, but when he should find it out, hugh did not want to be in the way.\n",
      "the watcher  ----  just about to retreat to the beach, when the dancing suddenly stopped.\n",
      "drops of rain  ----  beginning to fall, but the shower was not the reason for the cessation of the dancing.\n",
      "ohrante had ra ---- ed his arm in an impressive gesture.\n",
      "the dancers lo ---- d their weapons and rattles and drew back to the other side of the fire.\n",
      "lightning flashed, thunder pealed, there c ---- e a sharp dash of rain, the fire hissing and spitting like a live thing as the drops struck it.\n",
      "but ohrante did not intend to be deprived of h ----  cruel sport by a mere thunder shower.\n",
      "he held in h ----  right hand a long pole with a knife lashed to the end.\n",
      "standing just out of reach of the enraged  ---- ast’s antlers and forefeet, he lunged directly at its throat.\n",
      "there c ---- e a dazzling flash, a flare of light, a stunning crash that seemed to shatter hugh’s ear-drums.\n",
      "even as the flash blinded h ----  eyes, they received a momentary impression of a great black object hurtling at and over the giant indian, as he toppled backward into the fire.\n",
      "xxxvi how blaise missed his revenge the rain c ---- e down in torrents.\n",
      "thunder pealed and crashed, and hugh, a roaring in his head, his whole body shaking convulsively, lay on his face  ---- ong the bushes.\n",
      "a hand seized his shoulder and instantly he c ---- e to himself.\n",
      "he started up and reached for the knife he had borrowed from baptiste, then knew it  ----  his half-brother who was speaking.\n",
      "“quick,” bla ---- e whispered.\n",
      "“follow me close.” the rain was lessening, the thunder peals  ----  not so deafening.\n",
      "from the beach below c ---- e the sound of voices.\n",
      "with bitterness, hugh realized that he and bla ---- e had delayed too long.\n",
      "the indians had reached the one canoe and had discovered that the other  ----  missing.\n",
      "“they  ----  going to get away.\n",
      "we must do something to stop ohrante at least.” “ohrante  ----  stopped, i think,” blaise replied quietly.\n",
      "hugh followed close on h ----  younger brother’s heels.\n",
      "where the fire had blazed there  ----  now only smoke.\n",
      "as they drew near, there  ----  another bright flash.\n",
      "there lay the giant figure of ohrante the mohawk, his head  ---- ong the blackened embers, his broad chest battered to a shapeless mass by the sharp fore hooves of the frenzied moose.\n",
      "hugh  ----  glad that the flash of light lasted but an instant.\n",
      "the report of a musket, another and another, shouts and yells and splashings, c ---- e from the channel between island and mainland.\n",
      "not all of ohrante’s rascals will escape.” he ran down the open lane, bla ---- e after him.\n",
      "the flashes and reports, the shouts and cries, proved that a battle  ----  on.\n",
      "the black shapes of canoes filled with men  ----  distinguishable on the water.\n",

      "he swerved the canoe towards the line of low bushes at the foot of the gap, and hugh and bla ---- e ran out into the water to step aboard.\n",

      "“holá, hugh beaupré,” a f ---- iliar voice called.\n",
      "“where  ----  you?” “here, baptiste, all right, both of us,” hugh shouted in reply.\n",
      "“thank the good god,” bapt ---- te ejaculated fervently.\n",
      "the canoe c ---- e on and made a landing on the beach.\n",

      "but where  ----  ohrante?\n",
      " ----  he still on this isle?” “yes, he is here,” hugh replied, a little shudder convulsing his body.\n",

      "regretfully parting with bla ---- e, the elder brother had joined the great canoe fleet returning with the furs.\n",
      "he  ----  able to qualify as a canoeman, and he had remained with the fleet during the whole trip to montreal.\n",
      "of that interesting but strenuous journey there  ----  no space to tell here.\n",
      "one of the lad’s first acts after reaching the city had been to seek out monsieur dubo ---- .\n",
      "dubois proved to be a prominent man  ---- ong the french people of montreal, and hugh had found him without difficulty.\n",
      "he had learned from th ----  thin, grave, white-haired man that he, rené dubois, had lived in the indian country for many years.\n",
      "during the first months of jean beaupré’s life in the wild superior region, dubo ---- , though considerably older, had been the friend and companion of hugh’s father.\n",
      "when an inheritance had come to him, the elder man had  ----  called back to montreal, where he had since lived.\n",
      "beaupré, on h ----  infrequent returns to civilization, had made brief calls on his old comrade, but they had no common business interests and had never corresponded.\n",
      "monsieur dubois  ---- , therefore, at a loss to understand why hugh’s father had been so anxious that this packet should reach him.\n",
      "he undid the outer wrapping, glanced at his own n ---- e on the bark label, cut the cord, broke the seals and removed the doeskin.\n",
      "several thin white sheets of birch bark covered with fine writing in the faint, muddy, home-made ink, and a small, flat object wrapped in another thin cover of doeskin,  ----  all the packet contained.\n",
      "when h ----  fingers closed on the object within the skin cover, the man’s face paled, then flushed.\n",
      "h ----  hands trembled as he removed the wrapping.\n",
      "for several moments he sat staring at the little d ---- k of yellow metal, turning it over and over in his fingers.\n",
      "why it should affect monsieur dubo ----  so strongly hugh could not imagine.\n",
      "it  ----  obvious that the white-haired man was trying to control some strong emotion.\n",
      "without a word to the boy, he laid the disk down, and hugh could see that it  ----  a gold coin.\n",
      "taking the bark sheets from the table where he had laid them, dubo ----  scanned them rapidly, then turned again to the beginning and read them slowly and intently.\n",
      "when he raised his eyes, hugh was surprised to see that they  ----  glistening with tears.\n",
      "h ----  voice trembled as he spoke.\n",
      "“you cannot know, hugh  ---- aupré, what a great service you have done me.\n",
      "it  ----  impossible that i can ever repay you.\n",
      "“i shall be glad to answer anything that i can, monsieur dubois.” “well then, about that half-brother of yours, what sort of a lad is he?” “as fine a lad as you will find anywhere, monsieur,” hugh ans ---- d promptly.\n",
      "“when i first received his letter, i  ----  prejudiced against him, i admit.” he flushed and hesitated.\n",
      "dubo ----  nodded understandingly.\n",
      "“now i love him as if he  ----  my _whole_ brother,” hugh said warmly.\n",
      "a finer, truer-hearted fellow than blaise never existed.” again dubois nodded, app ---- ntly well satisfied.\n",
      "“and his mother?” “i  ----  surprised at his mother,” hugh replied with equal frankness.\n",
      "“she  ----  indian, of course, but without doubt a superior sort of indian.\n",
      "for one thing she  ----  clean and neatly dressed.\n",
      "she  ----  very good-looking too, her voice is sweet, her manner quiet, and she certainly treated me kindly.\n",
      "she loves bla ---- e dearly, and,—i think—she really loved my father.” once more monsieur dubois nodded, a light of pleasure in his dark eyes.\n",
      "“i asked,” he said abruptly, “because, you see, she  ----  my daughter.” “your daughter?\n",
      "but she is an indian!” “only half indian, but no wonder you  ----  surprised.\n",
      "i will explain.” monsieur dubois then told the wondering boy how, about thirty-eight years before, when he  ----  still a young man, he had taken to the woods.\n",
      "it was in the period between the conquest of canada by the english and the outbreak of the  ---- erican revolution, long before the formation of the northwest fur company, when the fur traders in the upper lakes region were practically all french canadians and free lances, each doing business for himself.\n",
      "in due time, rené dubo ---- , like most of the others, had married an indian girl.\n",
      "a daughter  ----  born to them, a pretty baby who had found a very warm spot in the heart of her adventurous father.\n",
      "before she  ----  two years old, however, he lost her.\n",
      "he had left h ----  wife and child at an indian village near the south shore of lake superior, while he went on one of his trading trips.\n",
      "on h ----  return he found the place deserted, the signs plain that it had been raided by some unfriendly band.\n",
      "there was no law in the indian country, and in that period, shortly after the so-called french and indian war, when the algonquin indians had sided with the french and the iroquoian with the english, conditions  ----  more than usually unstable.\n",
      "for years dubo ----  tried to trace his wife and daughter or learn their fate, but never succeeded.\n",
      "“and now,” he concluded, his voice again trembling with feeling, “you bring me proof that my daughter still lives, that she  ----  the wife of my friend, and that in his son and hers i have a grandson and an heir.” monsieur dubois took up the gold coin and handed it to hugh.\n",
      "one face had been filed smooth and on it, cut with some crude tool,  ----  the outlines of a coat-of-arms.\n",
      "“i did that myself,” dubo ----  explained.\n",
      "“it is the arms of my f ---- ily.\n",
      "when the child  ----  born, i made that and hung it about her neck on a sinew cord.” “and blaise’s mother still had it?” exclaimed hugh.\n",
      "it was an  ---- azing letter.\n",
      "jean beaupré merely mentioned how he had found the indian girl a captive  ---- ong the sioux, had bought her, taken her away and married her.\n",
      "no doubt he had told all th ----  to dubois before.\n",
      "beaupré had not had the slightest suspicion that his wife  ----  other than she believed herself to be, a full-blooded ojibwa.\n",
      "she had  ----  brought up by an ojibwa couple, but in a sioux raid her supposed father and mother had been killed and she had been captured.\n",
      "nearly two years  ---- fore the writing of the letter, beaupré had happened to receive a gold coin for some service rendered an official of the northwest company.\n",
      "his wife had ex ---- ined the coin with interest, and had said that she herself had once had one nearly like it, the same on one side, she said, but different on the other.\n",
      "she had always worn it on a cord around her neck, but when she  ----  captured, a sioux squaw had taken it from her.\n",
      "at first beaupré thought that the thing she had possessed had been one of the little medals sometimes given by a priest to a baptized child, but she had ins ---- ted that one side of her medal had been like the coin.\n",
      "then he remembered that h ----  old comrade dubois had told of the coin, bearing his coat-of-arms, worn by his baby daughter.\n",
      "jean beaupré said nothing of his suspicions to his wife, but he resolved to find out, if he could, whether she  ----  really the daughter of rené dubois.\n",
      "on th ----  quest, he twice visited the sioux country west of the mississippi.\n",
      "the autumn before the opening of th ----  story, he learned of the whereabouts of the very band that had held his wife a captive.\n",
      "after sending, by an indian messenger, a letter to hugh at the sault, asking the boy to wait there until h ----  father joined him in the spring, beaupré left at once for the interior.\n",
      "he  ----  fortunate enough to find the sioux band and the chief from whom he had bought the captive more than fifteen years before.\n",
      "the chief, judiciously bri ---- d and threatened, had sought for the medal and had found it in the possession of a young girl who said her mother had given it to her.\n",
      "when  ---- aupré questioned the old squaw, she admitted that she had taken the coin from the neck of an ojibwa captive years before.\n",
      "how the ojibwa couple who had brought the girl up had come by her, beaupré  ----  unable to find out, but he had no doubt that she was really the daughter of rené dubois.\n",
      "he resolved to send the proof of his wife’s p ---- ntage to montreal by his elder son, if hugh had really come to the sault and had waited there.\n",
      "if hugh  ----  not there, the elder beaupré would go to the city himself.\n",
      "it  ----  plain that he had not received either of the letters hugh had sent after him, nor had hugh ever got the one his father had written him.\n",
      "fearing that if any accident should happen to him, the coin and the story might never reach his old comrade, beaupré had written down the tale and prep ---- d the packet.\n",
      "even in h ----  dying condition he remembered it and told blaise to go get it.\n",
      "evidently, when he discovered he was in danger of falling into ohrante’s hands, he had fe ---- d to keep the packet with him, so had hidden it with the furs.\n",
      "if he escaped the giant, he could return for both furs and packet, but if the coin c ---- e into ohrante’s possession it would be lost forever.\n",

      "the elder marvell belonged, from the beginning to the end of h ----  useful and even heroic life, to the reformed church of england, or, as his son puts it, \"a conformist to the rites and ceremonies of the church of england, though i confess none of the most over-running and eager in them.\"\n",

      "anne's eldest son, joseph blaydes,  ----  mayor of hull in 1702, having married the daughter of a preceding mayor in 1698. the descendants of this branch still flourish.\n",
      "the popples also had children, one of whom, willi ----  popple, was a correspondent of his uncle the poet's, and a merchant of repute, who became in 1696 secretary to the board of trade, and the friend of the most famous man who ever sat at the table of that board, john locke.\n",
      "a son of this willi ----  popple led a very comfortable eighteenth-century life, which is in strong contrast with that of his grand-uncle, for, having entered the cofferers' office about 1730, he was made seven years later solicitor and clerk of the reports to the commissioners of trade and plantations, and in 1745 became in succession to a relative, one alured popple, governor of the bermudas, a post he retained until his death, which occurred not \"where the remote bermudas ride in the ocean's bosom unespied,\" but at his house in hampstead.\n",
      "so well placed and idle a gentleman was almost bound to be a bad poet and worse dr ---- atist, and this william popple was both.\n",
      "marvell's third sister, elizabeth, does not seem to have had issue, a certain thomas more, or moore, a fellow of magdalen college, c ---- bridge, whose name occurs in family records, being her stepson.\n",
      "important duties they were, for the old gr ---- mar school of hull dates back to 1486, and may boast of a long career of usefulness, never having fallen into that condition of decay and disrepute from which so many similar endowments have been of late years rescued by the beneficent and, of course, abused action of the charity commissioners.\n",

      "mr. grosart, who lacked nothing but the curb upon a too exuberant vocabulary, a little less enthusiasm and a great deal more d ---- cretion, to be a model editor, tells us in his invaluable edition of _the complete works in verse and prose of andrew marvell, m.p._,[8:1] that he had read a number of the elder marvell's manuscripts, consisting of sermons and miscellaneous papers, from which mr. grosart proceeds:-- \"i gather three things.\n",
      "\"(1) that he  ----  a man of a very brave, fearlessly outspoken character.\n",
      "some of his practical applications in his sermons before the magistrates  ----  daring in their directness of reproof, and melting in their wistfulness of entreaty.\n",
      "\"(2) that he  ----  a well-read man.\n",
      "his sermons  ----  as full of classical and patristic allusions and pat sayings from the most occult literatures as even bishop andrewes.\n",
      "\"(3) that he  ----  a man of tireless activity.\n",
      "besides the two offices n ---- ed, he became head of one of the great hospitals of the town (charter house), and in an address to the governors placed before them a prescient and statesmanlike plan for the better management of its revenues, and for the foundation of a free public library to be accessible to all.\"\n",
      "when at a later day, and in the midst of a fierce controversy, andrew marvell wrote of the clergy as \"the reserve of our chr ---- tianity,\" he doubtless had such men as his father in his mind and memory.\n",
      "it was at the old gr ---- mar school of hull, and with his father as his _orbilius_, that marvell was initiated into the mysteries of the latin grammar, and was, as he tells us, put to his \"montibus, inquit, erunt; et erant submontibus illis; risit atlantiades; et me mihi, perfide, prodis?\n",
      "me mihi prod ---- ?\n",
      "\"for as i remember this scanning was a liberal art that we learn'd at gr ---- mar school, and to scan verses as he does the author's prose before we did or were obliged to understand them.\n",
      "\"[8:2] irrational methods have often  ---- azingly good results, and the hull grammar school provided its head-master's only son with the rudiments of learning, thus enabling him to become in after years what john milton himself, the author of that terrible _treatise on education_ addressed to mr. hartlibb, affirmed andrew marvell to be in a written testimonial, \"a scholar, and well-read in the latin and greek authors.\"\n",
      "attached to the gr ---- mar school there was \"a great garden,\" renowned for its wall-fruit and flowers; so by leaving winestead behind, our \"garden-poet,\" that was to be, was not deprived of inspiration.\n",

      "molineus, peter r ---- us, seton, keckerman were text-books of reputation, from one or another of which every cambridge man had to master his _simpliciters_, his _quids_, his _secundum quids_, his _quales_, and his _quantums_.\n",
      "aristotle's physics, ethics, and politics were \"tutor's books,\" and those young men who loved to hear themselves talk were left free to discuss, much to hobbes's disgust, \"the freedom of the will, incorporeal substance, everlasting nows, ubiquities, hypostases, which the people understand not nor will ever c ----  for.\"\n",
      "in the life of matthew robinson,[11:1] who went up to c ---- bridge a little later than marvell (june 1645), and was probably a harder reader, we are told that \"the strength of his studies lay in the metaphysics and in those subtle authors for many years which rendered him an irrefragable disputant _de quolibet ente_, and whilst he was but senior freshman he was found in the bachelor schools, disputing ably with the best of the senior sophisters.\"\n",
      "robinson despised the old-fashioned ethics and physics, but with the new cartesian or experimental philosophy he  ----  _inter primos_.\n",

      "\"[12:1] the muses were never neglected at c ---- bridge, as the university exercises survive to prove, whilst modern languages, spanish and italian for example, were greedily acquired by such an eager spirit as richard crashaw, the poet, who came into residence at pembroke in 1631. there were problems to be \"kept\" in the college chapel, lectures to be attended, both public and private, declamations to be delivered, and even in the vacations the scholars were not exempt from \"exercises\" either in hall or in their tutors' rooms.\n",
      "earnest students read their greek test ---- ents, and even their hebrew bibles, and filled their note-books, working more hours a day than was good for their health, whilst the idle ones wasted their time as best they could in an unhealthy, over-crowded town, in an age which knew nothing of boating, billiards, or cricket.\n",
      "a tennis-court there  ----  in marvell's time, for in dr. worthington's _diary_, under date 3rd of april 1637, it stands recorded that on that day and in that place that learned man received \"a dangerous blow on the eye.\n",

      "this occurrence may serve to remind us how, during marvell's time at trinity, the university of c ---- bridge (ever the precursor in thought-movements) had a catholic revival of her own, akin to that one which two hundred years afterwards happened at oxford, and has left so much agreeable literature behind it.\n",
      "fuller in his history of the university of c ---- bridge tells us a little about this highly interesting and important movement:-- \"now began the university (1633-4) to be much beautified in buildings, every college either casting its skin with the snake, or renewing its bill with the eagle, having their courts or at least their fronts and gatehouses repaired and adorned.\n",
      "but the greatest alteration  ----  in their chapels, most of them being graced with the accession of organs.\n",
      "and seeing musick  ----  one of the liberal arts, how could it be quarrelled at in an university if they sang with understanding both of the matter and manner thereof.\n",

      "her loyalty  ----  no sickly fruit of \"church principles,\" for her strong intelligence rejected scornfully the slavish doctrines, alien to our political constitution, of divine right and passive obedience; but a loyalty, none the less, it was, of a very valuable kind.\n",

      "the tragedy of the 30th of january could never be forgotten, and it is possible that marvell's most f ---- ous verses, so nobly descriptive of the demeanour of the king on that memorable occasion, derived their inspiration from discourse at nunappleton.\n",

      "such  ----  the agreeable surroundings of our poet for two years, 1650-1652. i must leave it to the imaginations of my readers to fill up the picture, for excepting the poems, which we may safely assume were written at nunappleton house, and--who can doubt it?--read aloud to its inmates, there is nothing more to be said.\n",

      "none the less, the age loved distinction and appreciated wit, and to be known as a poet whose verses \"numbered good intellects\"  ----  to gain the _entrée_ to the society of men both of intellect and fashion, and also, not infrequently, snug berths in the public service, and secretaryships to foreign missions and embassies.\n",
      "thus there  ----  always, in addition to natural vanity, a strong motive for a seventeenth-century poet to publish his poems.\n",

      "[35:1] these verses were never owned by marvell, and it is probable that some of them, though attributed to him,  ----  not his at all.\n",

      "in a poem of 776 lines marvell tells the story and describes the charms of the house which lord fairfax built for himself during the war, and to which, as just narrated, he retired in the summer of 1650. the story is only too f ---- iliar a one, being writ large over many a fine property.\n",

      "property under the c ----  of the church is always supposed to be in danger, and the lady anna was freely credited with the desire to make a nun of her ward, and so keep her broad acres in wharfedale and her messuages in york for the use of mother church.\n",
      "none the less, the young lady was allowed to go about and visit her neighbours, and whilst so doing she fell in love with sir willi ----  fairfax, or he fell in love with her or with her estates.\n",
      "thereupon, so the story proceeds, the abbess kept her ward a close pr ---- oner within the nunnery walls.\n",
      "legal proceedings were taken, but in the end the privacy of the nunnery was invaded, and miss thwaites was abducted and married to sir willi ----  fairfax at the church of bolton percy.\n",
      "the lady abbess had to submit to _vis major_, but worse days  ----  in front of her, for she lived on to see the nunnery itself despoiled, and the fair domains she had during a long life preserved and maintained for religious uses handed over to the son of her former ward, isabella thwaites.\n",

      "fairfax may have made the two men known to each other, although it  ----  just as likely that milton introduced marvell to fairfax.\n",
      "all we know is that when the engagement at nunappleton house c ---- e to an end, marvell, being then minded to serve the state in some civil capacity, applied to the secretary for foreign tongues for what would now be called a testimonial, which he was fortunate enough to obtain in the form of a letter to the lord-president of the council, john bradshaw.\n",
      "milton seems always to have liked bradshaw, who  ----  not generally popular even on his own side, and in the _defensio secunda pro populo anglicano_ extols his character and attainments in sonorous latinity.\n",
      "bradshaw had become in february 1649 the first president of the new council of state, which, after the disappearance of the king and the abolition of the house of lords, took over the burden of the executive, and claimed the right to scrape men's consciences by administering to anybody it chose an oath requiring them to approve of what the house of commons had done against the king, and of their abolition of kingly government and of the house of peers, and that the legislative and supreme power  ----  wholly in the house of commons.\n",
      "before the creation of this council the duties of latin secretary to the parli ---- ent had been discharged by georg rudolph weckherlin, a german diplomat who had married an englishwoman.\n",
      "he retired in bad health at this time, and milton  ----  appointed to his place in 1649. when, later on, the sight of the most illustrious of all our civil servants failed him, weckherlin returned to the office as milton's assistant.\n",
      "in decem ---- r 1652 ill-health again compelled weckherlin's retirement.\n",
      "[49:1] milton's letter to bradshaw, who had made his home at eton, is dated february 21, 1653, and is as follows:-- \"my lord,--but that it would be an interruption to the public wherein your studies are perpetually employed, i should now and then venture to supply thus my enforced absence with a line or two, though it were onely my business, and that would be no slight one, to make my due acknowledgments of your many favours; which i both do at this time and ever shall; and have this farther, which i thought my part to let you know of, that there will be with you to-morrow upon some occasion of business a gentleman whose n ---- e is mr. marvile, a man whom both by report and the converse i have had with him of singular desert for the state to make use of, who also offers himself, if there be any employment for him.\n",
      "his father  ----  the minister of hull, and he hath spent four years abroad in holland, france, italy, and spain to very good purpose, as i believe, and the gaining of these four languages, besides he is a scholer and well-read in the latin and greek authors, and no doubt of an approved conversation, for he now comes lately out of the house of the lord fairfax, who was generall, where he was intrusted to give some instructions in the languages to the lady, his daughter.\n",
      "if upon the death of mr. weckerlyn the councell shall think that i shall need any assistance in the performance of my place (though for my part i find no encumbrance of that which belongs to me, except it be in point of attendance at conferences with  ---- bassadors, which i must confess in my condition i am not fit for) it would be hard for them to find a man so fit every way for that purpose as this gentleman: one who, i believe, in a short time would be able to do them as much service as mr. ascan.\n",
      "th ---- , my lord, i write sincerely without any other end than to perform my duty to the publick in helping them to an humble servant; laying aside those jealousies and that emulation which mine own condition might suggest to me by bringing in such a coadjutor; and remain, my lord, your most obliged and faithful servant, john milton.\n",
      "no handsomer testimonial than this  ----  ever penned.\n",
      "it  ----  unsuccessful.\n",
      "when milton wrote to bradshaw, weckherlin  ----  in fact dead, and on his retirement in the previous december, john thurloe, the very handy secretary of the council, had for the time assumed weckherlin's duties, and obtained on that score an addition to his salary.\n",
      "none the less, shortly afterwards, philip meadows, also a c ---- bridge man, was appointed milton's assistant, and marvell had to wait four years longer for his place.\n",
      "when marvell's connection with eton first began  ----  not to be ascertained.\n",
      "his friend, john oxenbridge, who had been driven from his tutorship at magdalen hall, oxford, by laud in 1634 to \"where the remote bermudas ride,\" but had returned home, bec ---- e in 1652 a fellow of eton college.\n",
      "oliver st. john, who at this time was chancellor of the university of c ---- bridge, and had married oxenbridge's sister, was known to marvell, and may have introduced him to his brother-in-law.\n",
      "at all events marvell frequently v ---- ited eton, where, however, he had the good sense to frequent not merely the cloisters, but the poor lodgings where the \"ever memorable\" john hales, ejected from his fellowship, spent the last years of his life.\n",

      "marvell's words of panegyric  ----  singularly well chosen.\n",
      "it is a curious commentary upon the confused times of the civil war and restoration that perhaps never before, and seldom, if ever, since, has england contained so many clear heads and well-prep ---- d breasts as it did then.\n",
      "small indeed  ----  the influence of men of thought upon their immediate surroundings.\n",
      "the lord bradshaw, we know, had a home in eton, and on the occasion of one of marvell's evidently frequent v ---- its to the oxenbridges, milton entrusted him with a letter to bradshaw and a presentation copy of the _secunda defensio_.\n",
      "marvell delivered both letter and book, and seems at once to have informed the d ---- tinguished author that he had done so.\n",
      "the sublime poet, who in his early manhood had composed _lycidas_, and  ----  in his old age to write _paradise lost_, demanded further and better particulars as to the precise manner in which the chief of his office received, not only the book, but the letter which accompanied it.\n",
      "nobody is now left to think much of bradshaw, but in 1654 he  ----  an excellent representative of the class carlyle was fond of describing as the _alors célèbre_.\n",
      "prompted by th ----  desire, milton must have written to marvell hinting, as he well knew how to do, his surprise at the curtness of his friend's former communication, and marvell's reply to this letter has come down to us.\n",
      "it is marvell's glory that long before _paradise lost_ he recognised the essential greatness of the blind secretary, and his letter is a fine ex ---- ple of the mode of humouring a great man.\n",
      "be it remembered, as we read, that this letter was not addressed to one of the greatest n ---- es in literature, but to a petulant and often peevish scholar, living of necessity in great retirement, whose name is never once mentioned by clarendon, and about whom the voluminous thurloe, who must have seen him hundreds of times, has nothing to say except that he was \"a blind man who wrote latin letters.\"\n",
      "odder still, perhaps, richard baxter, whose history of his own life and times is one of the most informing books in the world, never so much as mentions the one and only man whose n ---- e can, without any violent sense of unfitness, be given to the age about which baxter was writing so laboriously.\n",
      "\"honoured sir,--i did not satisfie my self in the account i gave you of presentinge your book to my lord, although it seemed to me that i writ to you all which the messenger's speedy returne the s ---- e night from eaton would permit me; and i perceive that, by reason of that hast, i did not give you satisfaction neither concerninge the delivery of your letter at the same time.\n",

      "i shall now studie it even to the getting of it by heart; esteeming it, according to my poore judgment (which yet i wish it  ----  so right in all things else), as the most compendious scale for so much to the height of the roman eloquence, when i consider how equally it turnes and rises with so many figures it seems to me a trajan's columne, in whose winding ascent we see imboss'd the severall monuments of your learned victoryes: and salmatius and morus make up as great a triumph as that of decebalus, whom too, for ought i know, you shall have forced, as trajan the other, to make themselves away out of a just desperation.\n",

      "but, indeed, the only civility which it  ----  proper for me to practice with so eminent a person is to obey you, and to perform honestly the work that you have set me about.\n",
      "therefore i shall use the time that your lordship  ----  pleased to allow me for writing, onely for that purpose for which you have given me it; that is, to render you an account of mr. dutton.\n",
      "i have taken care to ex ---- ine him several times in the presence of mr. oxenbridge, as those who weigh and tell over money before some witnesse ere they take charge of it; for i thought that there might be possibly some lightness in the coyn, or errour in the telling, which hereafter i should be bound to make good.\n",
      "therefore, mr. oxenbridge  ----  the best to make your excellency an impartial relation thereof: i shall only say, that i shall strive according to my best understanding (that is, according to those rules your lordship hath given me) to increase whatsoever talent he may have already.\n",

      "in composition this convention parli ---- ent was very like richard cromwell's, and indeed it contained many of the same members, whose loyalty, however, was less restrained than in 1659. all the world knew what brought this parliament together.\n",
      "it  ----  to make the nation's peace with its king, either on terms or without terms.\n",
      "\"we  ----  all royalists now\" are words which must often have been on the lips of the members of this house.\n",
      "such a right-about-face could never  ----  dignified.\n",
      "it  ----  impossible not to be reminded of schoolboys at the inevitable end of \"a barring out.\"\n",
      "the sarcastic comment of cl ---- ndon has not lost its sting.\n",
      "\"from this time there  ----  such an emulation and impatience in lords, commons, and city, and generally over the kingdom, who should make the most lively expressions of their duty and of their joy, that a man could not but wonder where those people dwelt who had done all the mischief and kept the king so many years from enjoying the comfort and support of such excellent subjects.\n",
      "\"[88:1] the most significant sentence in marvell's first letter to h ----  constituents is that in which he refers to the bill for making charles's declaration in religious matters the law of the land.\n",
      "had the passing of any such bill been possible, how different the h ---- tory of england would have been!\n",
      "the declaration marvell is referring to was contained in the f ---- ous message from breda, which was addressed by charles to all his loving subjects of what degree or quality, and was expressed as follows:-- \"and because the passion and uncharitableness of the times have produced several opinions in religion by which men are engaged in parties and animosities against each other (which, when they shall hereafter unite in a freedom of conversation, will be composed or better understood) we do declare a liberty to tender consciences, and that no man shall be disquieted or called in question for differences of opinion in matters of religion which do not disturb the peace of the kingdom; and that we shall be ready to consent to such an act of parliament as upon mature deliberation shall be offered to us for the full granting of that indulgence.\"\n",
      "it is only doing the king b ----  justice to say that he was always ready and willing to keep this part of his royal word--but it proved an impossibility.\n",
      "a roman catholic as a matter of creed, a hobbist in conversation, a sensualist in practice, and the shrewdest though most indolent of cynics in council, charles, in this matter of religious toleration, would gladly have kept his word, not indeed because it  ----  his word, for on the point of honour he was indifferent, but because it jumped with his humour, and would have mitigated the hard lot of the catholics.\n",
      "charles  ----  not a theorist, all his tastes being eminently practical, not to say scientific.\n",
      "he  ----  not a tyrant, but a _de facto_ man from head to heel.\n",
      "for the _jure divino_ of the english episcopate he c ---- d as little as oliver had ever done for the _jure divino_ of the english crown.\n",
      "oliver once said, and he  ----  not given to _braggadocio_, that he would fire his pistol at the king \"as soon as at another if he met him in battle,\" and the second charles would have thought no more of beheading an anglican bishop than he did of sending sir harry vane to the scaffold.\n",
      "honesty and virtue, on the r ----  occasions charles encountered them, he admired much as a painter admires the colours of a fine sunset.\n",
      "above everything else charles  ----  determined never again, if he could help it, to be sent on his travels, to be snubbed and starved in foreign courts.\n",
      "sir thomas urquhart of cromartie, the first and best translator of rabelais, is said to have died of laughing on hearing of the restoration; charles did not die, but he must have laughed inwardly at the spectacle that met his eyes everywhere as he made his often-described progress from dover to london, and ex ---- ined the gorgeous beds and quilts, fine linen and carpets, couches, horses and liveries, his faithful commons had been at the pains and at the expense of providing for his comfort.\n",
      "a few years afterwards marvell wrote the following lines:-- \"of a tall stature and of sable hue, much like the son of k ---- h, that lofty jew; twelve years complete he suffered in exile and kept his father's asses all the while.\n",
      "at length, by wonderful impulse of fate, the people called him home to help the state, and what  ----  more they sent him money too to clothe him all from head to foot anew; nor did he such small favours then disdain, who in his thirtieth year began his reign.\n",
      "why it was impossible for charles to keep his word may be read in cl ---- ndon's _life_, and in the history of the savoy conference, and need not be restated here.\n",
      "they had  ----  \"robbed\" of their tithes, and turned out of their palaces, rectories and vicarages, and excluded from the churches they still called \"theirs.\"\n",

      "its members all swore--what will not members of parli ---- ent swear?--that the king was supreme in church and state, the only rightful king of the realm and of all other his dominions, and that from their hearts they abhorred, detested, and abjured the damnable doctrine that princes, excommunicated or deprived of the pope, might be murdered by their subjects.\n",
      "they proceeded to pass a very useful act of indemnity and oblivion, agreeing to let bygones be bygones, except in certain n ---- ed cases.\n",
      "they ordered mr. john milton to be taken into custody, and prosecuted (which he never  ---- ) by the attorney-general.\n",
      "later on the poet  ----  released from custody, and we find mr. marvell complaining to the house that their sergeant had extracted £150 in fees before he would let mr. milton go.\n",

      "but the most graphic picture we have of this parli ---- ent is to be found in one of lord shaftesbury's political tracts entitled \"a letter from a parliament man to his friend\" (1675):-- \"sir,--i see you are greatly scandalized at our slow and confused proceedings.\n",
      "i confess you have cause enough; but were you but within these walls for one half day, and saw the strange make and complexion that this house is of, you would wonder as much that ever you wondered at it; for we are such a pied parli ---- ent, that none can say of what colour we are; for we consist of old cavaliers, old round-heads, indigent-courtiers, and true country gentlemen: the two latter are most numerous, and would in probability bring things to some issue were they not clogged with the numerous uncertainties of the former.\n",
      "for the old cavalier, grown aged, and almost past his vice, is d ---- nable godly and makes his doting piety more a plague to the world than his debauchery was, for he is so much a by-got to the b(ishop) that he forces his loyalty to strike sail to his religion, and could be content to pare the nails a little of the civil government, so you would but let him sharpen the ecclesiastical talons: which behaviour of his so exasperates the round-head, that he on the other hand cares not what increases the interest of the crown receives, so he can but diminish that of the miter: so that the round-head had rather enslave the man than the conscience: the cavalier rather the conscience than the man; there being a sufficient stock of animosity as proper matter to work upon.\n",
      "upon these, therefore, the courtier mutually plays, for if any ante-court motion  ----  made he gains the round-head either to oppose or absent by telling them, if they will join him now he will join them for liberty of conscience.\n",
      "and when any affair  ----  started on behalf of the country he assures the cavaliers, if they will then stand by him he will then join with them in promoting a bill against the fanatics.\n",
      "thus play they on both hands.... wherefore it were happy that he had neither round-head nor cavalier in the house, for they  ----  each of them so prejudicate against the other that their sitting here signifies nothing but their fostering their old venom and lying at catch to stop every advantage to bear down each other, though it be in the destruction of their country.\n",

      "[109:1] when marvell and the rest of them had ceased from giggling, the tsar inquired after the health of the king, but the distance between his imperial majesty and lord carlisle being too great for the question to carry, it had to be repeated by those who were nearer the  ---- bassador, who gravely replied that when he last saw his master, namely on the 20th of july then last past, he was perfectly well.\n",
      "to the s ---- e question as to the health of \"the desolate widow of charles the first,\" carlisle returned the same cautious answer.\n",
      "he then read a very long speech in engl ---- h, which his interpreter turned into russian.\n",
      "the s ---- e oration was rendered into latin by marvell, and presented.\n",
      "over marvell's latin trouble arose, for the russians  ----  bent on taking and giving offence.\n",
      "marvell had styled the tsar _illustrissimus_ when he ought, so it  ----  alleged, to have called him _serenissimus_.\n",
      "marvell  ----  not a schoolmaster's son, an old scholar of trinity, and milton's assistant as latin secretary for nothing.\n",
      "he prepared a reply which, as it does not lack humour, has a distinct literary flavour, and is all that c ---- e of the embassy, may here be given at length:-- \"i reply, saith he, that i sent no such paper into the embassy-office, but upon the desire of his tzarskoy majesty's councellor evan offonassy pronchissof, i delivered it to him, not being a paper of state, nor written in the english language wherein i treat, nor put into the hands of the near boyars and councellors of his tzarskoy majesty, nor subscribed by my self, nor translated into russe by my interpreter, but only as a piece of curiosity, which is now restored me, and i am possessed of it; so that herein his tzarskoy majestie's near boyars and councellors are doubtless ill grounded.\n",
      "but again i say concerning the value of the words _illustrissimus_ and _serenissimus_ compared together, seeing we must here from affaires of state, fall into gr ---- matical contests concerning the latin tongue; that the word _serenus_ signifieth nothing but still and calm; and, therefore, though of late times adopted into the titles of great princes by reason of that benigne tranquility which properly dwells in the majestick countenance of great princes, and that venerable stillness of all the attendants that surround them, of which i have seen an excellent example when i was in the presence of his tzarskoy majesty, yet is more properly used concerning the calmness of the weather, or season.\n",
      "so that even the night  ----  elegantly called _serena_ by the best authors, cicero in arato 12, lucretius i. l. 29.\n",
      "'_serena nox_'; and upon perusing again what i have writ in th ----  paper, i finde that i have out of the customariness of that expression my self near the beginning said, and that most serene night, &c. whereas on the contrary _illustris_ in its proper derivation and signification expresseth that which is all resplendent, lightsome, and glorious, as well without as within, and that not with a secondary but with a primitive and original light.\n",
      "for if the sun be, as he is, the first fountain of light, and poets in their expressions (as is well known) are higher by much than those that write in prose, what else is it when ovid in the 2. of the met ---- orphoses saith of phoebus speaking with phaëthon, _qui terque quaterque concutiens illustre caput_, and the latin orators, as pliny, ep.\n",
      "139, when they would say the highest thing that can  ----  exprest upon any subject, word it thus, _nihil illustrius dicere possum_.\n",
      "so that hereby may appear to h ----  tzarskoy majestie's near boyars and counsellors what diminution there is to his tzarskoy majesty (which farr be it from my thoughts) if i appropriate _serenissimus_ to my master and _illustrissimus_ to him than which _nihil dici potest illustrius_.\n",
      "but because this  ----  in the time of the purity of the latin tongue, when the word _serenus_ was never used in the title of any prince or person, i shall go on to deale with the utmost candor, forasmuch as in this nation the nicety of that most eloquent language is not so perfectly understood, which gives occasion to these mistakes.\n",
      "i confess therefore that indeed in the declination of the latin tongue, and when there scarce could be found out words enough to supply the modern  ---- bition of titles, serenissimus as several other words hath grown in fashion for a compellation of lesser as well as greater princes, and yet befits both the one and the other.\n",
      "so there  ----  _serenissima respublica veneta_, _serenitates electoriæ_, _serenitates regiæ_, even as the word highness or _celsitudo_ befits a duke, a prince, a king, or an emperour, adjoyning to it the respective quality, and so the word _illustris_.\n",
      "but suppose it were by modern use (which i deny) depressed from the undoubted superiority that it had of _serenus_ in the purest antiquity, yet being added in the transcendent degree to the word emperour, the highest denomination that a prince is capable of, it becomes of the s ---- e value.\n",
      "so that to interpret _illustr ---- simus_ unto diminution is to find a positive in a superlative, and in the most orient light to seek for darkness.\n",
      "and i would, seeing the near boyars and counsellors of his tzarskoy majesty are pleased to mention the title given to his tzarskoy majesty by his cesarian majesty, gladly be satisfied by them, whether ever any cesarian majesty writ formerly hither in high-dutch, and whether then they styled his tzarskoy majesty durchluchtigste which is the s ---- e with _illustrissimus_, and which i believe the cæsar hath kept for himself.\n",
      "but to cut short, his royal majesty hath used the word to his tzarskoy majesty in his letter, not out of imitation of others, although even in the dutch letter to his tzarskoy majesty of 16 june 1663, i finde durchlauchtigste the s ---- e (as i said) with _illustrissimus_, but out of the constant use of his own court, further joyning before it most high, most potent, and adding after it great lord emperour, which is an higher title than any prince in the world gives his tzarskoy majesty, and as high a title of honour as can be given to any thing under the divinity.\n",
      "for the king my master who possesses as considerable dominions, and by as high and self-dependent a right as any prince in the universe, yet contenting himself with the easiest titles, and satisfying himself in the essence of things, doth most willingly give to other princes the titles which  ----  appropriated to them, but to the tzarskoy majesties of russia his royal ancestors, and to his present tzarskoy majesty his royal majesty himself, have usually and do gladly pay titles even to superfluity out of meer kindness.\n",
      "yet, that you may find i did not out of any criticisme of honor, but for distinction sake use it as i did, you may see in one place of the s ---- e speech _serenitas_, speaking of his tzarskoy majesty: and i would have used _serenissimus_ an hundred times concerning his tzarskoy majesty, had i thought it would have pleased him better.\n",
      "and i dare promise you that his majesty will upon the first information from me stile him _serenissimus_, and i (notwithstanding what i have said) shall make little difficulty of altering the word in that speech, and of delivering it so to you, with that protestation that i have not in using that word _illustrissimus_ erred nor used any diminution (which god forbid) to his tzarskoy majesty, but on the contrary after the ex ---- ple of the king my master intended and shewed him all possible honor.\n",
      "and so god grant all happiness to h ----  most high, most potent, most illustrious, and most serene tzarskoy majesty, and that the friendship may daily increase betwixt his said majesty and his most serene majesty my master.\"\n",
      "on the 19th of february the tsar invited lord carlisle and his suite to a dinner, which, beginning at two o'clock, lasted till eleven, when it  ----  prematurely broken up by the tsar's nose beginning to bleed.\n",
      "five hundred dishes  ----  served, but there were no napkins, and the table-cloths only just covered the boards.\n",

      "the latter committee almost at once reported to the house, to quote from marvell's letter of the 27th of october, \"that his majesty be desired to issue out his procl ---- ation that all popish priests and jesuits, except such as not being natural-born subjects, or belong to the queen mother and queen consort, be banished in thirty days or else the law be executed upon them, that all justices of peace and officers concerned put the laws in execution against papists and suspected papists in order to their execution, and that all officers, civil or military, not taking the oaths of supremacy and allegiance within twenty days be displaced.\"\n",

      "the profligacy of the court, and the general decay of manners, when added to the severity of the leg ---- lation against the nonconformists, gave the ejected clergy opportunities for a renewal of their spiritual ministrations, and as usual their labours, _pro salute animarum_, aroused political dissatisfaction.\n",
      "some of the more outrageous supporters of the royal prerogative, the renegade may  ---- ong them, professed to see in the fire a punishment upon the spirit of freedom, for which the city had once been famous, and urged the king not to suffer it to be rebuilt again \"to be a bit in his mouth and a bridle upon his neck, but to keep it all open,\" and that his troops might enter whenever he thought necessary, \"there being no other way to govern that rude multitude but by force.\"\n",
      "rabid nonsense of this kind had no weight with the king, who never showed his native good sense more conspicuously than in the pains he took over the rebuilding of london; but none the less it had its effect in getting rid once and for ever of that spirit of excessive (besotted is hall ---- 's word) loyalty which had characterised the restoration.\n",
      "the king, of course, wanted money, nor was parli ---- ent disposed to refuse it, we being still at war with holland; but to the horror of that elderly pedant, lord clarendon, the commons passed a bill appointing a commission of members of both houses \"to inspect\"--i am now quoting marvell--\"and examine thoroughly the former expense of the £2,800,000, of the £1,250,000 of the militia money, of the prize goods, etc.\"\n",
      "in an earlier letter marvell attributes the new temper of parli ---- ent, \"not to any want of ardour to supply the public necessities, but out of our house's sense also of the burden to be laid upon the subject.\"\n",
      "cl ---- ndon was so alarmed that he advised a dissolution.\n",
      "charles was alarmed, too, knowing well that both carteret, the treasurer of the navy, and lord ashley, the treasurer of the prize money, issued out many sums upon the king's warrant, for which no accounts could be produced, but he was still more frightened of a new parli ---- ent.\n",
      "in the present parli ---- ent he had, so clarendon admits, \"a hundred members of his own menial servants and their near relations.\"\n",
      "the bishops were also against a dissolution, dreading the return of presbyterian members, so cl ---- ndon's advice was not followed, and the king very reluctantly consented to the commission, about which pepys has so much to say.\n",

      "all the scandals, and they were many and horrible, relating to clarendon and his daughter, the duchess of york, find a place in marvell's satires and epigr ---- s.\n",
      "to us lord clarendon is a grave and thoughtful figure, the statesman-author of _the history of the rebellion and civil wars in england_, that f ---- ous, large book, loftily planned, finely executed, full of life and character and the philosophy of human existence; and of his own _autobiography_, a production which, though it must, like burnet's _history_, be read with caution, unveils to the reader a portion of that past which usually is as deeply shrouded from us as the future.\n",
      "if at times we  ----  reminded in reading clarendon's _life_ of the old steward in hogarth's plate, who lifts up his hands in horror over the extravagance of his master, if his pedantry often irritates, and his love of place displeases, we recognise these but as the shades of the character of a distinguished and accomplished public servant.\n",
      "but to marvell clarendon was rapacious,  ---- bitious, and corrupt, a man who had sold oliver's dunkirk to the french, and shared the price; who had selected for the king's consort a barren woman, so that his own damaged daughter might at least chance to become queen of england, who hated parliaments and hankered after a standing army, who took money for patents, who sold public offices, who was bribed by the dutch about the terms of peace, who swindled the ruined cavaliers of the funds subscribed for their benefit, and had by these methods heaped together great wealth which he ostentatiously displayed.\n",
      "even darker crimes than these  ----  hinted at.\n",
      "that marvell was wrong in his estimate of cl ---- ndon's character now seems certain; clarendon did not get a penny of the dunkirk money.\n",
      "the case made against him by the house of commons in their articles of impeachment was felt even at the time to be flimsy and incapable of proof, and in the many records that have come to light since cl ---- ndon's day nothing has been discovered to give them support.\n",
      "and yet marvell was a singularly well-informed member of parli ---- ent, a shrewd, level-headed man of affairs, who knew lord clarendon in the way we know men we have to see on business matters, whose speeches we can listen to, and whose conduct we discuss and criticise.\n",
      "\"gently scan your brother-man\"  ----  a precept marvell never took to heart; nor is the house of commons a place where it is either preached or practised.\n",
      "when cl ---- ndon was well nigh at the height of his great unpopularity, he built himself a fine big house on a site given him by the king where now is albemarle street.\n",
      "true, he bought the stones from the dean and chapter, but if the man you hate builds a great house out of the ruins of a church,  ----  it likely that so trivial a fact as a cash payment for the materials is going to be mentioned?\n",
      "splendid furniture and noble pictures were to be seen going into the new palace--the gifts, so it was alleged, of foreign  ---- bassadors.\n",
      "what  ----  the consideration for these donations?\n",

      "but suppose \"we  ----  commanded by our lawful prince to say with our tongue we believe not, must we obey such command?\"\n",
      "here hobbes a little hesitates to say outright \"yes, you must\"; but he does say \"whatsoever a subject  ----  compelled to do in obedience to his own sovereign, and doth it not in order to his own mind, but in order to the laws of his country, that action is not his, but his sovereign's--nor is it that he in this case denieth christ before men, but his governor and the law of his country.\"\n",

      "parker seeks to grapple with th ----  difficulty.\n",
      "he d ---- owns hobbes.\n",
      "\"when men have once swallowed this principle, that mankind is free from all obligations antecedent to the laws of the commonwealth, and that the will of the sovereign power is the only measure of good and evil, they proceed suitably to its consequences to believe that no religion can obtain the force of law till it is established as such by supreme authority, that the holy scriptures were not laws to any man till they were enjoyn'd by the christian magistrate, and that if the sovereign power would decl ----  the alcoran to be canonical scripture, it would be as much the word of god as the four gospels.\n",
      "(see _hob ---- s_, vol.\n",
      "so that all religions  ----  in reality nothing but cheats and impostures to awe the common people to obedience.\n",
      "and therefore although princes may w ---- ely make use of the foibles of religion to serve their own turns upon the silly multitude, yet 'tis below their wisdom to be seriously concerned themselves for such fooleries.\"\n",
      "as against th ----  fashionable hobbism, parker pleads conscience.\n",
      "\"when anything that is app ---- ntly and intrinsically evil is the matter of a human law, whether it be of a civil or ecclesiastical concern, here god is to be obeyed rather than man.\"\n",
      "he forcibly adds:-- \"those who would take off from the consciences of men all obligations antecedent to those of human laws, instead of making the power of princes supreme, absolute and uncontrollable, they utterly enervate all their authority, and set their subjects at perfect li ---- rty from all their commands.\n",
      "for if we once remove all the antecedent obligations of conscience and religion, men will no further be bound to submit to their laws than only as themselves shall see convenient, and if they  ----  under no other restraint it will be their wisdom to rebel as oft as it is their interest.\"\n",
      "but though when dealing with hobbes, parker thinks fit to assert the claims of conscience so strongly, when he has to grapple with those who, like the immortal author of _the pilgrim's progress_, \"devil ---- hly and perniciously abstained from coming to church,\" and upheld \"unlawful meetings and conventicles,\" his tone alters, and it is hard to distinguish his position from that of the philosopher of malmesbury.\n",
      "parker's argument briefly stated, and as much as possible in h ----  own vigorous language, comes to this: there is and always must be a competition between the prerogative of the prince or state and that of conscience, which on this occasion is defined as \"every private man's own judgment and persuasion of things.\"\n",

      "the first part of _the rehearsal transprosed_, though its sub-title is \"animadversions upon a late book intituled a preface shewing what grounds there are of fears and jealousies of popery,\" deals after marvell's own fashion with all three of parker's books, the _ecclesiastical politie_, the _br ---- hall preface_, and the _defence of the ecclesiastical politie_.\n",

      "i cannot give a better description of marvell's method than in parker's own words in his preface to his _reproof to the rehearsal transprosed_, which appeared in 1673 and gave rise to marvell's second part:-- \"when,\" writes parker, \"i first condemned myself to the drudgery of this reply, i intended nothing but a serious prosecution of my argument, and to let the world see that it is not reading histories or plays or gazettes, nor going on pilgrimage to geneva, nor learning french and italian, nor passing the alps, nor being a cunning g ---- ester that can qualify a man to discourse of conscience and ecclesiastical policy; in that it is not capping our argument with a story that will answer it, nor clapping an apothegm upon an assertion that will prove it, nor stringing up proverbs and similitudes upon one another that will make up a coherent discourse.\"\n",
      "allowing for bias this is no unfair account of marvell's method, and it was just because this was marvell's method that he succeeded so well in  ---- using the king and in pleasing the town, and that he may still be read by those who love reading with a fair measure of interest and enjoyment.\n",

      "marvell  ----  occasionally humorous and not infrequently carries a jest beyond the limits of becoming mirth; but he is more often grave.\n",
      "yet when he is, his gravity  ----  treated either as one of his feebler jokes or as an impertinence.\n",
      "but as it  ----  his wit alone that has kept him alive he need not be pitied overmuch.\n",
      "the substance of marvell's reply to parker, apart altogether from its by-play,  ----  to be found in passages like the following:-- \"here it is that after so great an excess of wit, he thinks fit to take a julep and re-settle his brain and the government.\n",
      "he grows as serious as 't ----  possible for a madman, and pretends to sum-up the whole state of the controversy with the nonconformists.\n",
      "and to be sure he will make the story as plausible for himself as he may; but therefore it  ----  that i have before so particularly quoted and bound him up with his own words as fast as such a proteus could be pinion'd.\n",
      "for he is as waxen as the first matter, and no form comes  ---- iss to him.\n",

      "for though he found it not till it  ----  too late in the cause, yet he felt it all along (which is the understanding of brutes) in the effect.\n",
      "for hence it is that he so often complains that princes know not aright that supremacy over consciences, to which they  ----  so lately, since their deserting the church of rome, restored; that in most nations government was not rightly understood, and many expressions of that nature: whereas indeed the matter is, that princes have always found that uncontroulable government over _conscience_ to be both unsafe and impracticable.\n",
      "he had run himself here to a stand, and perceived that there was a god, there was scripture; the magistrate himself had a conscience, and must 'take c ----  that he did not enjoyn things apparently evil.'\n",

      "he threatens, he rails, he jeers them, if it were possible, out of all their consciences and honesty; and finding that will not do, he calls out the magistrate, tells him these men  ----  not fit to live; there can be no security of government while they are in being.\n",

      "\"[165:1] in reply to what parker had written about the unreasonable fuss made by the dissenters over the \"two or three symbolical ceremonies\" called sacr ---- ents, marvell says:-- \"they (the nonconformists) complain that these things should be imposed on them with so high a penalty as want nothing of a sacramental nature but divine institution.\n",
      "and because a human institution is herein made of equal force to a divine institution therefore it is that they  ----  aggrieved.... for without the sign of the cross our church will not receive any one in baptism; as also without kneeling no man is suffered to come to the communion.... but here, i say, then is their (the nonconformists') main exception that things indifferent and that have no proper signature or significancy to that purpose should by command be made conditions of church-communion.\n",

      "that which he saw in matter of doctrine, he would not discern in discipline.... it is true and very piously done that our church doth decl ----  that the kneeling at the lord's supper is not enjoined for adoration of those elements and concerning the other ceremonies as before.\n",
      "but the roman ---- ts (from whom we have them and who said of old we would come to feed on their meat as well as eat of their porridge) do offer us here many a fair declaration and distinction in very weighty matters to which nevertheless the conscience of our church hath not complyed.\n",
      "but in this particular matter of kneeling which c ---- e in first with the doctrine of transubstantiation, the romish church do reproach us with flat idolatry, in that we, not believing the real presence in the bread and wine, yet do pay to something or other the same adoration.\n",

      "the triple alliance  ----  not only very popular in england, but was good diplomacy, for it was quite within the range of practical politics that france and holland might have combined against england; nor could it easily be maintained that the alliance was hostile to france, as it provided that spain should be forced to accept the terms france had already proposed.\n",

      "\"this s ---- e oath had been brought into the house of commons in the plague year at oxford, to have been imposed upon the nation, but there, by the assistance of those very same persons that now introduce it, 'twas thrown out, for fear of a general infection of the vitals of this kingdom; and though it passed then in a particular bill, known by the name of the five mile act, because it only concerned the non-conformist preachers, yet even in that, it was thoroughly opposed by the late earl of southampton, whose judgement might well have been reckoned for the standard of prudence and loyalty.\n",

      "\"all these considerations put together  ----  sufficient to make any honest and well advised man to conceive indeed, that upon the passing of this oath and declaration, the whole sum of affairs depended.\n",
      "\"it grew therefore to the greatest contest, that has perhaps ever been in parli ---- ent, wherein those lords, that were against this oath, being assured of their own loyalty and merit, stood up now for the english liberties with the same genius, virtue, and courage, that their noble ancestors had formerly defended the great charter of england, but with so much greater commendation, in that they had here a fairer field and a more civil way of decision; they fought it out under all the disadvantages imaginable; they were overlaid by numbers; the noise of the house, like the wind, was against them, and if not the sun, the fireside was always in their faces; nor being so few, could they, as their adversaries, withdraw to refresh themselves in a whole day's ingagement: yet never was there a clearer demonstration how dull a thing is humane eloquence, and greatness how little, when the bright truth discovers all things in their proper colours and dimensions, and shining, shoots its beams thorow all their fallacies.\n",

      "\"[205:1] in a letter to his constituents, dated april 22, 1675, marvell was content to say: \"the lords sate the whole day yesterday till ten at night without rising (and the king all the while but of our addresses present) upon their bill of test in both houses and  ----  not yet come to the question of committing it.\"\n",
      "after prolonged discussion the oath bill  ----  sent to the commons, where doubtless it must have passed, had not a furious privilege quarrel over sir john fagg's case made prorogation in june almost a necessity.\n",
      "in october parli ---- ent met again, and at once resolved itself into a committee upon religion to prevent the growth of popery.\n",
      "this time the king made almost an end of the parli ---- ent by a prorogation which lasted from november 1675 until february 1677--a period of fifteen months.\n",
      "on the re-assembling of parli ---- ent the duke of buckingham fathered the argument much used during the long recess, that a prorogation extending beyond twelve months was in construction of law a dissolution.\n",
      "for the expression of this opinion and the refusal to recant it the duke of buckingh ----  and three other lords were ordered to the tower, the king being greatly angered by the duke's request that his cook might be allowed to wait on him.\n",
      "on this incident marvell remarks: \"thus a prorogation without precedent was to be warranted by an imprisonment without ex ---- ple.\n",
      "whereby the dignity of parli ---- ent and especially of the house of peers did at present much suffer and may probably more for the future, _for nothing but parliament can destroy parliament_.\n",
      "if a house shall once be felon of itself and stop its own breath, taking away that liberty of speech which the king verbally, and of course, allows them (as now they had done in both houses) to what purpose  ----  it coming thither?\n",
      "\"[206:1] the character of th ----  house of commons did not improve with age.\n",
      "marvell writes in the _growth of popery_:-- \"in matters of money they seem at first difficult, but having been discoursed with in private, they  ----  set right, and begin to understand it better themselves, and to convert their brethren: for they are all of them to be bought and sold, only their number makes them cheaper, and each of them doth so overvalue himself, that sometimes they outstand or let slip their own market.\n",
      "\"it  ----  not to be imagined, how small things, in this case, even members of great estates will stoop at, and most of them will do as much for hopes as others for fruition, but if their patience be tired out, they grow at last mutinous, and revolt to the country, till some better occasion offer.\n",
      "\" ---- ong these are some men of the best understanding were they of equal integrity, who affect to ingross all business, to be able to quash any good motion by parliamentary skill, unless themselves be the authors, and to be the leading men of the house, and for their natural lives to continue so.\n",
      "but these are men that have been once fooled, most of them, and discovered, and slighted at court, so that till some turn of state shall let them in their adversaries' place, in the mean time they look sullen, make big motions, and contrive specious bills for the subject, yet only wait the opportunity to be the instruments of the s ---- e counsels which they oppose in others.\n",
      "\"there is a third part still remaining, but as contrary in themselves as light and darkness; those are either the worst, or the best of men; the first are most profligate persons, they have neither estates, consciences, nor good manners, yet are therefore picked out as the necessary men, and whose votes will go furthest; the charges of their elections are defrayed, whatever they  ---- ount to, tables are kept for them at whitehall, and through westminster, that they may be ready at hand, within call of a question: all of them are received into pension, and know their pay-day, which they never fail of: insomuch that a great officer was pleased to say, 'that they came about him like so many jack-daws for cheese at the end of every session.'\n",
      "if they be not in parli ---- ent, they must be in prison, and as they are protected themselves, by privilege, so they sell their protections to others, to the obstruction so many years together of the law of the land, and the publick justice; for these it is, that the long and frequent adjournments are calculated, but all whether the court, or the monopolizers of the country party, or those that profane the title of old cavaliers, do equally, though upon differing reasons, like death apprehend a dissolution.\n",
      "but notwithstanding these, there is an handful of salt, a sparkle of soul, that hath hitherto preserved this gross body from putrefaction, some gentlemen that  ----  constant, invariable, indeed englishmen; such as are above hopes, or fears, or dissimulation, that can neither flatter, nor betray their king or country: but being conscious of their own loyalty and integrity, proceed throw good and bad report, to acquit themselves in their duty to god, their prince, and their nation; although so small a scantling in number, that men can scarce reckon of them more than a _quorum_; insomuch that it is less difficult to conceive how fire was first brought to light in the world than how any good thing could ever be produced out of an house of commons so constituted, unless as that is imagined to have come from the rushing of trees, or battering of rocks together, by accident, so these, by their clashing with one another, have struck out an useful effect from so unlikely causes.\n",
      "but whatsoever casual good hath been wrought at any time by the assimilation of  ---- bitious, factious and disappointed members, to the little, but solid, and unbiassed party, the more frequent ill effects, and consequences of so unequal a mixture, so long continued, are demonstrable and apparent.\n",
      "for while scarce any man comes thither with respect to the publick service, but in design to make and raise his fortune, it is not to be expressed, the debauchery, and lewdness, which, upon occasion of election to parli ---- ents, are now grown habitual thorow the nation.\n",
      "so that the vice, and the expence,  ----  risen to such a prodigious height, that few sober men can indure to stand to be chosen on such conditions.\n",
      "from whence also arise feuds, and perpetual animosities, over most of the counties and corporations, while gentlemen of worth, spirit, and ancient estates and dependances, see themselves overpo ---- d in their own neighbourhood by the drunkness and bribery, of their competitors.\n",
      "but if nevertheless any worthy person chance to carry the election, some mercenary or corrupt sheriff makes a double return, and so the cause is handed to the committee of elections, who ask no better, but  ----  ready to adopt his adversary into the house if he be not legitimate.\n",
      "and if the gentleman agrieved seek his remedy against the sheriff in westminster-hall, and the proofs be so palpable, that the king's bench cannot invent how to do him injustice, yet the major part of the twelve judges shall upon better consideration vacate the sheriff's fine and reverse the judgement; but those of them that d ----  dissent from their brethren are in danger to be turned off the bench without any cause assigned.\n",
      "while men therefore c ----  not thus how they get into the house of commons, neither can it be expected that they should make any conscience of what they do there, but they are only intent how to reimburse themselves (if their elections were at their own charge) or how to bargain their votes for a place or a pension.\n",
      "they list themselves straightways into some court faction, and it is as well-known  ---- ong them, to what lord each of them retain, as when formerly they wore coats and badges.\n",
      "by this long haunting so together, they are grown too so f ---- iliar among themselves, that all reverence of their own assembly is lost, that they live together not like parliament men, but like so many good fellows met together in a publick house to make merry.\n",
      "and which  ----  yet worse, by being so thoroughly acquainted, they understand their number and party, so that the use of so publick a counsel is frustrated, there is no place for deliberation, no perswading by reason, but they can see one another's votes through both throats and cravats before they hear them.\n",

      "-- audacia stod ved k ---- mervinduet, som aabnede sit lille, trekantede øje højt oppe over karnapper og brede gadetrapper midt paa det store tag.\n",
      "derfor slog hun vinduet op og holdt sit ansigt hen mod den friske luftstrøm, der vældede ind fra den frostkl ----  nat.\n",
      "ved b ---- lag og vinduesskodder var der tynde lysstriber.\n",

      "ventede med s ---- me længsel som de andre aar, men med sygere haab!\n",

      "kulden str ---- mede sig haardt sammen om hendes legeme -- hun ejede ikke et vaaben mod vilddyrene, hun kendte ikke sti over den vide hede eller gennem de mørke kløfter, men endnu havde hun ikke mødt den store tavse hersker, _tiden_, der ene kunde bringe lys, og derfor ilede hun frem, saa ustandseligt, som om den medlidelse, der brændte i hende, kunde bære som vingepar.\n",

      "men med rædsel saa audacia, at hvor han nærmede sig, smuldredes træet og søndredes gulvets og murens sten; den vimse _ihærdighed_ og den tavse, stærke _hjælpsomhed_ arbejdede med hast i hans spor, at ikke hallen skulde styrte s ---- men om dem alle.\n",
      "_mistænksomhed_ krøb s ---- men i en ensom krog og rugede beængstet over sin giftflaske.\n",
      "med s ---- menbidte læber og blodunderløbne øjne sad _vold_ hos den vindtørre _gerrighed_, der fredløs og ængstelig holdt med sine lange, knoglede fingre om sin broder _volds_ blodplettede arme.\n",
      "og _indignationen_, en ungdomsfr ---- k, skøn mand med varme, faste øjne og et staalblankt spyd i sin kraftige haand stod som en frygtløs helt midt inde blandt alle de onde skikkelser.\n",
      "_løgnagtigheden_ sneg sig rundt s ---- men med en dukket, vrikkende kvindeskikkelse, _sledskeriet_; de sluttede venskab med hver som gad; deres hvidgule ansigter var stivnede og udtryksløse, og deres syge, væmmelige hænder besudlede, hvad de rørte ved.\n",
      "med løgnagtig venlige lader nærmede de sig audacia; hendes hjærte nagedes af smerte over dette m ---- brug af ædelt jordisk væsen; nu stod de hende nær, og flokke af ord om godhed og troskab udgik fra dem.\n",
      "da flygtede audacia sjæleangst ind til den ældg ---- le, som gud havde sat til hersker over disse forfærdelige budbringere.\n",

      "audacias hjærte slog stille mod _taalmods_ roligt aandende bryst; der dalede en forunderlig mild kraft ned over hende fra d ---- se alvorligt glade øjne, der snart saa vidt og ømt ud over jorden, snart fæstede sig i stille, længselsfuld lykke mod stjernebillederne paa den fjerne, mørke himmel.\n",
      "-- -- -- det g ---- le aars sidste øjeblik veg bort.\n",
      "en bølgende, mangfoldig rungende og klingende tonesk ----  svang sig ud over staden fra alle dens høje taarne.\n",
      "_taalmod_ skred ind i den ensomme stue oppe under taget; ilden fl ---- mede lysnende op, og usynlige blomster duftede sødt og stærkt.\n",

      "hun forn ----  visheden om, at den, der havde baaren hende over de døde, kolde snesletter, kunde beskærme mod alt det, som ødelæggende sneg sig ind paa menneskene, løb storm mod deres fred og gjorde deres maal lave og deres verden snever og kold.\n",
      "kom til mig, du, som er størst af alle tidens sendebud!« taalmod sv ---- de: »min gerning er kun at bane vej til menneskenes hjærter for dem, som er større end jeg, og som evner at skænke det højeste.« som et svindende billede stod den lyse skikkelse i døraabningen.\n",
      "solskin over toppede, smaa bølger, over den nybyggede, hvidmalede skonnertbrig, der glider langsomt gennem sundet ud fra den fynske søkøbstad med det ene kirketaarn og de mange røde tage; solskin, der faar selve røgen fra den lille d ---- per, der slæber skonnerten ud, til at se munter ud, solskin over vimpler og flags rødt og hvidt, over de feststemte mennesker ombord og de skovklædte kyster og de grønne øer.\n",
      "skonnertbriggens kaptajn er en stor lyshaaret og lysskægget mand med skarpe, blaa øjne og en vældig latter, der i dag hvert øjeblik faar lov til at runge; han er glad i disse timer, befinder sig saa vel i sin rolle som vært for rhedere med f ---- ilie og venner, der følge sundet ud og senere vil tage tilbage med den lille slæber.\n",

      "derfor er der noget lokkende i dette: igen at skulle ud alene, være fri for sludder baade fra den ene og fra den anden kant ... ud at  ---- søge hans sorte majestæt i afrika, ud til ensomme, drømmende timer i kahytten, naar passaten fylder »neptuns« tyve svulmende sejl.\n",
      "han vilde nok have været hjemme den dag, gaaet ved hendes side op ad kirkegulvet, hørt hendes svar til præsten og senere -- i en kreds af slægt og venner -- udtalt noget af det, som vilde fylde hans hjærte paa en saadan dag, hvor hans eneste barn traadte ind til livets sorger og fristelser og selv overtog ansv ---- t for sine handlinger.\n",
      "aah, hun skulde nok kl ----  sig!\n",

      "\"go,\" he said to an officer, \"and instantly take off those irons when you take him inside the pr ---- on.\"\n",
      "i was taken in and the irons  ----  taken off.\n",

      "from the day i entered the pr ---- on i made up my mind to behave as well as i could; to be docile and obedient, and to comply with every rule and order.\n",
      "warden robinson  ----  a model man for his position.\n",
      "he believed that pr ---- oners could be reformed more easily by mild than by harsh measures--at least they would be more contented with their lot and would be subordinate.\n",
      "every now and then he would ask prisoners if they  ----  well treated by the officers; how they were getting on; if they had enough to eat, and so on.\n",
      "the officers seemed imbued with the warden's spirit; the chaplain of the prison, who conducted the sunday, services and also held a sunday school,  ----  one of the finest men in the world, and took a personal interest in every prisoner.\n",
      "altogether, it  ----  a model institution.\n",
      "but in spite of good treatment i  ----  intensely miserable; my mind was morbid; i was nearly, if not quite, insane; and one day during the dinner hour, i opened a vein in each arm in hopes that i should bleed to death.\n",
      "bleed i did, till i fainted away, and as i did not come out when the other prisoners did, the officer c ---- e to my cell and discovered my condition.\n",
      "he at once sent for the doctor who c ---- e and stopped the hemorrhage, and then sent me to the hospital where i remained two weeks.\n",
      "after i c ---- e out of the hospitals the warden talked to me about my situation and feelings.\n",
      "he advised me to go into the blacksmith shop, of course not dre ---- ing that i knew anything of the work; but he said i would have more liberty there; that the men moved about freely and could talk to each other; that the work mainly was sharpening picks and tools, and that i could at least blow and strike.\n",
      "but, debilitated as i  ---- , the work was too hard for me, and so the warden put me in the yard to do what i could.\n",
      "i also swept the halls and ass ---- ted in the cook-room.\n",
      "one day when the warden spoke to me, i told him that i knew something about taking c ----  of the sick, and after some conversation, he transferred me to the hospital as a nurse.\n",
      "here, if there is such a things as contentment in prison, i  ----  comparatively happy.\n",
      "i nursed the sick and admin ---- tered medicines under direction of the doctor.\n",
      "i had too, with all easy position, more liberty than any other pr ---- oner.\n",
      "i could go anywhere about the halls and yard, and in a few weeks i  ----  frequently sent on an errand into the town.\n",
      "one day i ventured to speak to him about his horse, of which he  ----  very proud, and indeed the horse was a very fine one.\n",
      "mr. warden, said i \"that's a noble horse of yours; but he interferes badly, and that  ----  only because he is badly shod.\n",
      "exclaimed the warden in great surpr ---- e; \"well, if you can, i'll give you a good piece of bread and butter, or, anything else you want.\"\n",
      "\"i don't want your bread and butter,\" said i \"but i will shoe your horse as he has never  ----  shod before.\"\n",
      "of course, i knew that by \"bread and butter\" the warden meant that if i could shoe h ----  favorite horse so as to prevent him from interfering, he would gladly favor me as far as he could; and i knew, too, that i could make as good a shoe as any horse need wear.\n",
      "i gladly led the horse to the shop where i had so signally failed in pick and tool sharpening, and  ----  received with jeers by my old comrades who wanted to know what i was going to do to that horse.\n",
      "this greatly increased the mirth of my former shopmates; but their  ---- usement speedily changed to amazement as they saw me make my nails, turn the shoes and neatly put them on.\n",
      "in due time the horse  ----  shod, and i led him to the warden for inspection; and before him and an officer who stood by him, i led the horse up and down to show that he did not interfere.\n",
      "the warden's delight was unbounded; he never saw such a set of shoes; he decl ---- d that they fitted as if they had grown to the horse's hoofs.\n",
      "i need not say that from that day till the day i left the prison, i had everything i wanted from the warden's own table; i f ---- d as well as he did, and had favors innumerable.\n",

      "yet so it  ---- .\n",
      "for talking now almost daily, in the hospital or in the yard, with the warden, he bec ---- e interested in me, and in answer to his inquiries i told him the whole story of my persecution, as i considered it, my trial and my unjust and severe sentence.\n",
      "when he had heard all he said: \"you ought not to  ----  here another day; you ought to go out.\"\n",
      "the good chaplain also interested himself in my case, and after hearing the story, he and the warden took a lawyer n ---- ed bemis, into their counsel, laid the whole matter before him and asked his opinion.\n",
      "mr. bem ---- , after hearing all the circumstances, expressed the belief that i might get a pardon.\n",
      "he entered into the matter with h ----  whole heart.\n",
      "he sent for my son henry and my first wife, and they c ---- e and corroborated my statement about the mutual agreement for separation, and told how long we had been parted.\n",

      "the governor after due deli ---- ration consented to their request.\n",
      "they c ---- e back to charlestown with the joyful intelligence.\n",
      "warden robinson advised my son, that considering my present mental and physical condition, he had better break the intelligence gradually to me, and so henry c ---- e to me and said, simply, that he thought he would soon have \"good news\" for me.\n",

      "i had two hundred dollars in my pocket and i offered him any reasonable sum, if he would only let us cross; but no, he knew the scheimers better than he knew me, and their goodwill  ----  worth more than mine.\n",
      "here was a block to the g ---- e, indeed.\n",
      "i had sent my baggage forward in the morning to belvidere; sarah had nothing but the clothes she wore, for she was so c ---- fully watched that she could carry or send nothing away; but she was ready to go if the obstinate ferryman had not prevented us.\n",
      "while we were pressing the ferryman to favor us, down c ---- e one of sarah's brothers with a dozen neighbors, and told her she must return home or he would carry her back by force.\n",
      "whereupon one fellow took hold of me and i promptly knocked him down, and notified the crowd that the first who laid hands on me, or who attempted to take her home violently, would get a dose from my p ---- tol which i then exhibited: \"sarah must go willingly or not at all,\" said i. the production of my pistol, the only weapon in the crowd, brought about a new state of affairs, and the brother and others tried persuasion; but sarah stoutly insisted that she would not return.\n",
      "\"now hold on,\" boys, said i, \"i  ----  going to say something to her.\"\n",
      "i then took her aside and told her that there  ----  no use in trying to run away then; that she had better go home quietly, and tell the folks that she was sorry for what she had done, that she had broken off with me, and would have nothing more to do with me; that i would surely see her to-morrow, and then we could make a new plan.\n",
      "i went to a public house half a mile  ---- low the ferry.\n",
      "that night the gang c ---- e down to this house with the intention of driving me away from the place, or, possibly, of doing something worse; but while they were howling outside, the landlord sent me to my room and then went out and told the crowd i had gone away.\n",
      "i told her to  ----  ready on the following thursday night and i would have a ladder against her window for her to escape by.\n",
      "she prom ---- ed to be ready.\n",
      "meantime, though i had been in the house but a few minutes, some one who had seen me go in gathered the crowd of the day before, and the first thing i knew the house  ----  beseiged.\n",
      "i  ----  told to leave the place or they would kill me.\n",
      "one of sarah's brothers ran into the house, brought out a musket and aimed it at me; but it m ---- sed fire.\n",
      "i drew my p ---- tol the crowd keeping well away then, and told him that if he did not instantly bring that musket to me i would shoot him.\n",
      "then the old lady c ---- e out, bringing a carpet bag containing my books and things, asking me to see if \"it was all right.\"\n",
      "i had no disposition to stop and ex ---- ine just then; i told the mob i had no other business there; that i was going away, and to my surprise, i confess, i was permitted to leave the place unmolested.\n",
      "it  ----  quite certain the ferryman made no objection to my crossing, and i went to belvidere where i remained quietly till the appointed thursday night, when i started with a trusty man for scheimer's.\n",
      "ever since her attempt to elope, sarah had  ----  watched night and day, and to prevent her abduction by me, mr. scheimer had two or three men in the house to stand guard at night.\n",
      "sarah  ----  locked in her room, which is precisely what we had provided for, for no one in the house supposed that she could escape by the window.\n",
      "there was a big dog on the premises, but he and i were old friends, and he seemed very glad to see me when i c ---- e on the ground on this eventful night.\n",
      "sarah was watching, and when i made the signal she opened the window and threw out her ready prep ---- d bundle.\n",
      "then my man and i set the ladder and she c ---- e safely to the ground.\n",
      "a moment more and we would have stolen away, when, as ill luck would have it, the ladder fell with a great crash, and the infernal dog, that a moment  ---- fore seemed almost in our confidence, set up a howl and then barked loud enough to wake the dead.\n",
      "forthwith  ---- sued from the house old scheimer, two of his sons and his hired guard--a half dozen in all.\n",
      "there  ----  a time then.\n",
      "the girl  ----  instantly seized and taken into the house.\n",
      "then all hands fell upon us two, and though i and my man fought our  ---- st they managed to pound us nearly to death.\n",
      "the dog, too, in revenge no doubt for the sc ----  the ladder had given him, or perhaps to show his loyalty to his master, assisted in routing us, and put in a bite where he could.\n",
      "it is a wonder we  ----  not killed.\n",
      "sarah, meanwhile,  ----  calling out from the house, and imploring them not to murder us.\n",
      "we reached it, and hastily unhitching and getting in we drove rapidly for the bridge crossing over to  ---- lvidere.\n",
      "that  ---- autiful august night had very few charms for us.\n",
      "it would have  ----  different indeed if i had succeeded in securing my sarah; and to think of having the prize in my very grasp, and the losing all!\n",
      "we reached the hotel in belvidere at about half-past two o'clock in the morning, wearied, worn, bru ---- ed and disheartened.\n",
      "of course, i had no means of knowing the feelings or condition of the loved girl from whom i had  ----  so suddenly and so violently parted.\n",
      "i only learned from an easton man whom i knew and whom i met in the city, that \"sarah scheimer was sick\"--that was all; the man said he did'nt know the f ---- ily very well, but he had heard that miss scheimer had been \"out of her head, if not downright crazy.\"\n",
      "how mad and how miserable that poor girl was made by her own f ---- ily, i did not know till months afterward, and then i had the terrible story from her own lips.\n",
      "it seems that when her father and h ----  gang returned from pursuing me, as they did a little way up the road towards belvidere, they found her almost frantic.\n",
      "how she passed that night, after the scenes she had witnessed, and the abuse with which her father and brothers had loaded her before they thrust her into her pr ---- on, may be imagined.\n",
      "the next day she  ----  wrought up to a frenzy.\n",
      "her parents pronounced her insane, and called in a dutch doctor who ex ---- ined her and said she was \"bewitched!\"\n",
      "and th ----  is the remedy he proposed as a cure; he advised that she should be soundly flogged, and the devil whipped out of her.\n",
      "her f ---- ily, intensely angered at her for the trouble she had made them, or rather had caused them to make for themselves, were only too glad to accept the advice.\n",
      "the old man and two sons carried a sore bru ---- e or two apiece they got from me the night before, and seized the opportunity to pay them off upon her.\n",
      "so they stripped her b ---- , and flogged her till her back was a mass of welts and cuts, and then put her to bed.\n",
      "that bed she never left for two months, and then c ---- e out the shadow of her former self.\n",
      "but the dutch doctor decl ---- d that the devil was whipped out of her, and that she was entirely cured.\n",
      "a few months afterward the f ---- ily had the best of reasons for believing that they had whipped the devil into her, instead of out of her.\n",
      "i wrote at least fifty letters to her, but as i learned afterward, and, indeed, surmised at the time, every one of them  ----  intercepted by her father or brothers, and she did not know where i was and so could not write to me.\n",
      "i had some business there which  ----  soon transacted, and early in june i went over to new jersey--to oxford, a small place near belvidere.\n",
      "this place i meant to make my base of operations for the new c ---- paign i had been planning all winter.\n",
      "i \"put up\" at a public house kept by a man who  ----  known in the region round about as the \"boston yankee,\" for he migrated from boston to new jersey and was doing a thriving business at hotel keeping in oxford.\n",
      "what a thorough good-fellow he  ----  will presently appear.\n",
      "i had been in the hotel four days and had become pretty intimate with the landlord before i ventured to make inquiries about what i  ----  most anxious to learn; but finally i asked him if he knew the scheimers over the river?\n",
      "he looked at me in a very comical way, and then broke out: \"well, i decl ---- , i thought i knew you, you're the chap that tried to run away with old scheimer's daughter sarah, last august; and you're down here to get her this time, if you can.\"\n",
      "i owned up to my identity, but warned boston yankee that if he told any one who i  ---- , or that i was about there, i'd blow his brains out.\n",
      "\"you keep cool,\" said he, \"don't you  ----  uneasy; i'm your friend and the gal's friend, and i'll help you both all i can; and if you want to carry off sarah scheimer and marry her, i'll tell you how to work it.\n",
      "you see she has been watched as closely as possible all winter, ever since she got well, for she  ----  crazy-like, awhile.\n",
      "well, you could'n't get ne ---- r to her, first off, than you could to the north pole; but do you remember mary smith who was servant gal, there when you boarded with scheimer?\"\n",
      "i remembered the girl well and told him so, and he continued: \"well, i saw her the other day, and she told me she  ----  living in easton, and where she could be found; now, i'll give you full directions and do you take my horse and buggy to-morrow morning early and go down and see her, and get her to go over and let sarah know that you're round; meantime i'll keep dark; i know my business and you know yours.\"\n",
      "i need not say how overjoyed i  ----  to find this new and most unexpected friend, and how gratefully i accepted his offer.\n",
      "he gave me the street, house and number where mary smith lived and during the evening we planned together exactly how the whole affair  ----  to be managed, from beginning to end.\n",
      "i went to bed, but could scarcely sleep; and all night long i  ----  agitated by alternate hopes and fears for the success of the scheme of to-morrow.\n",
      "it  ----  saturday morning, and after an early breakfast i was on the road with boston yankee's fast horse; towards easton.\n",
      "on my arrival there i had no difficulty in finding mary smith, who recognized me at once, and  ----  very glad to see me.\n",
      "she knew i had come there to learn something about sarah; she had seen her only a week ago; she  ----  well again, and the girls had talked together about me.\n",
      "this  ----  pleasant to hear, and i at once proposed to mary to go to scheimer's and tell sarah that i was there; i would give her ten dollars if she would go.\n",
      "when we were well on the road i said to her: \"now, mary, attend carefully to what i say: you will need to be very cautious in breaking the news to sarah that i  ----  here; she has already suffered a great deal on my account, and may be very timid about my being in the neighborhood; but if she still loves me as you say she does, she will run any risk to see me, and, if i know her, she will be glad to go away with me.\n",
      "now, this is what you must do; you must see her alone and tell her my plan; here, take this di ---- ond ring; she knows it well; manage to let her see it on your finger; then tell her that if she is willing to leave home and marry me, i will be in the woods half a mile above her house to-morrow afternoon at 5 o'clock, with a horse and buggy ready to carry her to belvidere.\n",
      "if she will not, or d ----  not come, give her the ring, and tell her we part, good friends, forever.\"\n",
      "it  ----  a beautiful afternoon as we drove along the road.\n",
      "we talked about sarah and old times, and i made her repeat my instructions over and over again and she prom ---- ed to convey every word to sarah.\n",
      "we ne ---- d scheimer's house about six o'clock, and when we were a little way from there i told mary to get out, so as to excite no suspicions as to who i was; she did so, and i waited till i saw her go into the house, and then drove rapidly by towards the belvidere bridge, and was safely at oxford by nightfall.\n",
      "i told my friend, the landlord, what i had done, and he said that everything  ----  well planned.\n",
      "he also prom ---- ed to go with me next day to assist me if necessary, and, said he: \"if everything is all right, do you carry off the girl and i'll walk up to belvidere; but don't bring sarah this way--head toward water gap.\n",
      "when you're married fast and sure, you can come back here as le ---- urely as you're a mind to, and nobody can lay a hand upon you or her.\"\n",
      "we arranged some other minor details of our expedition and i went to  ---- d.\n",
      "the next afternoon at four o'clock i  ----  at the appointed place, and boston yankee was with me.\n",
      "i did not look for sarah  ---- fore five o'clock, so we tied our horse and kept a good watch upon the road.\n",
      "an hour went by and no sarah appe ---- d.\n",
      "i told boston yankee i did not  ---- lieve she would come.\n",
      "\"don't  ----  impatient; wait a little longer,\" said my friend.\n",
      "in twenty minutes we saw emerge, not from scheimer's house, but from his eldest son's house, which was still ne ---- r to the place where we were waiting, three women, two of whom i recognized as sarah and mary, and the third i did not know, nor could i imagine why she was with the other two; but as i saw them, leaving boston yankee in the woods, i drove the horse down into the road.\n",
      "as sarah drew near she kissed her hand to me and c ---- e up to the wagon.\n",
      "\" ----  you ready to go with me?\"\n",
      "\"i  ---- , indeed,\" was her reply, and i put out my hand to help her into the buggy.\n",
      "but the third woman caught hold of her dress, tried to prevent her from getting in, and began to scre ----  so as to attract attention at sarah's brother's house.\n",
      "when we had gone on a mile or two, i asked sarah what all th ----  meant?\n",
      "she told me that the woman was her brother's servant; that mary and herself left her father's house a little after four o'clock to go over and call at her brother's; that just before five, when she was to meet me, she and mary proposed to go out for a walk; that the whole f ---- ily watched her constantly, and so her brother's wife told the servant woman to get on her things and go with them.\n",
      "\"you, may  ----  sure,\" she, added, \"that the woman will arouse the whole neighborhood, and that they will all be after us.\"\n",
      "we  ----  going toward water gap, as boston yankee had advised, and when we were about eight miles on the way, i deemed it prudent to drive into the woods and to wait till night before going on.\n",
      "we  ----  effectually concealed; our pursuers, if there were any, would be sure to go by us, and meantime we could talk over our plans for the future.\n",
      "sarah told me that when mary c ---- e to the house the night before, she was not at all surprised to see her, as she occasionally came up from easton to make them a little visit, and to stay all night; that she went to the summer-house with mary to sit down and talk, and almost immediately saw the ring on mary's finger; that when she saw it she at once recognized it, and asked her: \"o!\n",
      "\"keep quiet,\" said mary: \"don't talk loud, or some one may hear you; don't be agitated; your lover  ----  near, and has sent me to tell you.\"\n",
      "it  ----  joyful news to sarah, and how readily she had acquiesced in my plan for an elopement was manifest in the fact that she was then by my side.\n",
      "we bad not been in the woods an hour when, as i anticipated, we heard our pursuers, we did not know how many there  ---- , drive rapidly by.\n",
      "\"oh no, my dear,\" i replied, \"now is just the time to wait quietly here;\" and wait we did till eight o'clock, when our pursuers, having gone on a few miles, and having seen or learned nothing of the fugitives, c ---- e by again \"on the back track.\"\n",
      "i waited a while longer to let our friend's get a little ne ---- r home and further away from us, and then took the road again toward water gap.\n",
      "we rested awhile, and then drove le ---- urely on nine miles further, where we waited till daylight and crossed the river.\n",
      "we  ----  in no great hurry now; we were comparatively safe from pursuit.\n",
      "we soon c ---- e to a public house, where we stopped and put out the horse, intending to take breakfast.\n",
      "while i was inquiring of the landlord if there was a justice of the peace in the neighborhood, the landlord's wife had elicited from sarah the fact of our elopement, who she was, who her folks  ---- , and so on.\n",
      "the well-meaning landlady advised sarah to go back home and get her p ---- nts consent before she married.\n",
      "sarah suggested that the very impossibility of getting such consent  ----  the reason for her running away; nor did it appear how she was to go back home alone even if she desired to.\n",
      "we saw that we could get no help there, so i countermanded my order for breakfast, offering at the s ---- e time to pay for it as if we had eaten it, ordered out my horse and drove on.\n",
      "i  ----  an old offender myself; i ran away with my wife; there is a justice of the peace two miles from here, and if you'll come in i'll have him here within an hour.\"\n",
      "we had reached the right place at last, for while the landlady  ----  getting breakfast for us, and doing her best to make us comfortable and happy, the old offender himself took his horse and carriage and went for the justice.\n",
      "by the time we had finished our breakfast he was back with him, and sarah and i  ----  married in \"less than no time,\" the old offender and his wife singing the certificate as witnesses.\n",
      "we  ----  married now, and all the scheimers in pennsylvania were welcome to come and see us if they pleased.\n",
      "no scheimers c ---- e that day; but the day following came a deputation from that family, some half dozen delegates, and with them a constable from easton, with a warrant to arrest sarah for something--i never knew what--but at any rate he was to take her home if necessary by force.\n",
      "the old offender declined to let these people into his house; sarah told me to keep out of the way and she would see what  ----  wanted.\n",
      "whereupon she boldly went to the door and greeted those of her acquaintances who  ----  in the party.\n",
      "\"well then, i have a warrant to take you; but if you  ----  married, i have no power over you.\"\n",
      "well married i  ---- , said sarah, and she produced the certificate, and the old offender and his wife came out and declared that they witnessed the ceremony.\n",
      "what  ----  to be done?\n",
      "evidently nothing; only the constable ordered a whole barrel of ale to treat his posse and any one about tire town who chose to drink, and the barrel  ----  rolled out on the grass, tapped, and for a half hour there was a great jollification, which was not exactly in honor of our wedding, but which afforded the greatest gratification to the constable, his retainers, and those who happened to gather to see what was going on.\n",
      "th ----  ended, and the bill paid, the easton delegation got into their wagons and turned their horses heads towards home.\n",
      "we passed three delightful days under the old offender's roof, and then thanking our host for h ----  kindness to us, and paying our bill, we started on our return journey for oxford.\n",
      "we were close by the scheimer homestead, which was but a few miles away across the river; but we fe ---- d neither father nor brothers, nor even the woman who was so unwilling to let sarah go with me.\n",
      "the constable, and the rest had carried home the news of our marriage, and the old folks made the  ---- st of it.\n",
      "the day after we received th ----  invitation, boston yankee offered to take sarah over home, and promised to bring her safely back.\n",
      "so she went,  ----  treated tolerably well, at any rate, she secured her clothes and brought them home with her.\n",
      "it was now time to bid f ---- well to our staunch friend, boston yankee.\n",
      "we found a good boarding place, and i began to practice medicine, after we had been there a while, sarah wrote home to let her f ---- ily know where she was, and that she was well and happy.\n",
      "her father wrote in reply that we both might come there at any time, and that if she would come home he would do as well by her as he would by any of h ----  children.\n",
      "th ----  letter made sarah uneasy.\n",
      "in spite of all the ill usage she had received from her parents and f ---- ily, she was nevertheless homesick, and longed to get back again.\n",
      "i could see that th ----  feeling grew upon her daily.\n",
      "we  ----  pleasantly situated where we were; i had a good and growing practice, and we had made many friends; but this did not satisfy her; she had some property in her own right, but her father was trustee of it, and he had hitherto kept it away from her from spite at her love affair with me.\n",
      "but now she was to be taken into favor again, and she represented to me that we could go back and get her money, and that i could establish myself there as well as anywhere; we could live well and happily  ---- ong her friends and old associations.\n",
      "these things  ----  dinged in my ears day after day, till i was sick of the very sound.\n",
      "i could see that she  ----  bound, or, as the dutch doctor would have said, \"bewitched\" to go back, and at last, after five happy months in goshen, in an evil hour i consented to go home with her.\n",
      "return to scheimer--peace and then pandemonium--frightful f ---- ily row--running for refuge--the gang again--arrest at midnight--struggle with my captors--in jail once more--put in irons--a horrible prison breaking out--the dungeon--sarah's baby--curious compromises--old scheimer my jailer--signing a bond--free again--last words from sarah.\n",
      "we went back to the scheimer homestead and  ----  favorably received.\n",
      "there was no special enthusiasm over our return, no marked demonstrations of delight; but they seemed glad to see us, and all the unpleasant things of the past, if not forgotten,  ----  tacitly ignored on all sides.\n",
      "we passed a pleasant evening together in what seemed a re-united f ---- ily circle--one of the brothers only was absent--and next morning we met cordially around the breakfast table.\n",
      "i really began to think it  ----  possible that all the old difficulties might be healed, and that the pleasant picture sarah painted, at goshen, about settling down happily in pennsylvania, could be fully realized.\n",
      "after breakfast i took a conveyance to go three or four miles to see a man who owed me some money for medical services in his f ---- ily, and was away from scheimer's three or four hours.\n",
      "during this brief absence i could not help thinking with genuine satisfaction of the happiness sarah  ----  experiencing in the gratification of her longing to return home again.\n",
      "surely, i thought, she must  ----  happy now.\n",
      "no more homesickness, and a full and complete reconciliation with her f ---- ily; all the anger, abuse, and blows forgotten or forgiven; she restored to her place in the family; and even her objectionable husband received with open arms.\n",
      "but what an enormous difference there  ----  between fancy and fact.\n",
      "during this brief absence of mine, had come home the brother who had always seemed to concentrate the hatred of the whole f ---- ily towards me for the wrong they assumed i had done to the youngest daughter who loved me.\n",
      "sarah  ----  fairly frantic.\n",
      "the whole f ---- ily were abusing her.\n",
      "the returned brother especially, was calling her all the vile n ---- es he could lay his tongue to.\n",
      "i learned afterwards that he had been doing it ever since he c ---- e into the house that day and found her at home and heard that i was with her.\n",
      "they had picked, wrenched rather, out of her the secret i had confided to her that i had another wife from whom i  ----  \"separated,\" but not divorced.\n",
      "my sudden presence on this scene  ----  not exactly oil on troubled waters; it was gunpowder to fire.\n",
      "her mother turned and shouted at me that i had  ---- tter fly at once or they would kill me.\n",
      "meanwhile, that mob, which the scheimer boys seemed always to have at hand,  ----  gathering in the dooryard.\n",
      "i managed to get near enough to sarah to tell her that i would send a man for her next day, and then if she was willing to come with me she must get away from her f ---- ily if possible.\n",
      "i think the gang had an ind ---- tinct knowledge of the situation, or they would have mobbed me, and perhaps killed me.\n",
      "they knew something  ----  \"to pay\" at scheimer's, but did not know exactly what.\n",
      "once on the road it  ----  my intention to have gone over to belvidere, and then on to oxford, where i should have found a sure refuge with my friend boston yankee.\n",
      "would that i had done so; but i  ----  a fool; i thought i could be of service to sarah by remaining near her; might see her next day; i might even be able to get her out of the house, and then we could once more elope together and go back again to goshen where we had been so happy.\n",
      "it is strange that i did not once realize what a perilous position i was in myself--that, firmly as i believed myself to be wedded to sarah, i was in fact  ---- enable to the law, and liable to arrest and punishment.\n",
      "all th ----  never occurred to me.\n",
      "i saw one or two of the gang who  ----  at scheimer's about the hotel, but they did not offer to molest me, and i paid no particular attention to them.\n",
      "i did not know then that they  ----  spies and were watching my movements.\n",
      "at nine o'clock i went to  ---- d.\n",
      "at midnight, or thereabouts, i  ----  roughly awakened and told to get up.\n",
      "without waiting for me, to comply, five men who had entered my room pulled me out of bed, and almost before i could huddle on my clothes i  ----  handcuffed.\n",
      "then one of them, who said he  ----  a constable from easton, showed a warrant for my arrest.\n",
      "what the arrest  ----  for i was not informed.\n",
      "i  ----  taken down stairs, put into a wagon, the men followed, and the horses started in the direction of easton.\n",
      "i remembered how in, all the bedl ----  in the house that morning she still cried out: \"i will go with him.\"\n",
      "i remembered how, only a few months before, she had been brutally flogged in that very ch ---- ber, to \"get the devil out of her.\"\n",
      "i remem ---- red, too, the many happy, happy hours we had passed together.\n",
      "and here  ----  i, handcuffed and dragged in a wagon, i knew not whither.\n",
      "this for thoughts--in the way of action,  ----  all the while trying to get my handcuffs off, and at last i succeeded in getting one hand free.\n",
      "waiting my opportunity till we c ---- e to a piece of woods, i suddenly jumped up and sprang from the wagon.\n",
      "it  ----  a very dark night, and in running into the woods i struck against a tree with such force as to knock me down and nearly stun me.\n",

      "i should have escaped, only a high rail fence brought me to a sudden stop, and i  ----  too exhausted to climb over it.\n",
      "my pursuers who  ----  hard at my heels the whole while now laid hold of me.\n",
      "in the subsequent struggle i got out my pocket knife, and stabbed one of them, cutting h ----  arm badly.\n",
      "then they overpo ---- d me.\n",
      "it  ----  nearly daylight when i was thrust into jail.\n",
      "there  ----  no cells, only large rooms for a dozen or more men, and i was put, into one of these with several prisoners who were awaiting trial, or who had been tried and were there till they could be sent to prison.\n",
      "it  ----  a day or two before i found out what i was there for.\n",
      "then a dutch deputy sheriff, who was also keeper of the jail, c ---- e and told me that i was held for bigamy, adding the consoling intelligence that it would be a very hard job for me, and that i would get five or six years in state prison sure.\n",
      "i  ----  well acquainted in easton, and i sent for lawyer litgreave for assistance and advice.\n",
      "i sent also to my half-sister in delaware county, n. y., and in a day or two she c ---- e and saw me, and gave mr. litgreave one hundred dollars retaining fee.\n",
      "my lawyer went to see the scheimers and when he returned he told me that he hoped to save me from state prison--at all events he would exercise the influence he had over the f ---- ily to that end; but i must expect to remain in jail a long time.\n",
      "prec ---- ely what this meant i did not know then; but i found out afterwards.\n",
      "soon after this visit from the lawyer, the deputy sheriff c ---- e in and said that he was ordered \"by the judge\" to iron me, and it was done.\n",
      "they  ----  heavy leg-irons weighing full twelve pounds, and i may say here that i wore them during the whole term of my imprisonment in this jail, or rather they wore me--wearing their way in time almost into the bone.\n",
      "i had been here a week now, and  ----  well acquainted with the character of the place.\n",
      "it  ----  indescribably filthy; no pretence was made of cleansing it.\n",
      "the prisoners  ----  half fed, and, at that, the food was oftentimes so vile that starving men rejected it.\n",
      "the deputy who kept the jail  ----  cruel and malignant, and took delight in torturing his prisoners.\n",
      "he would come in sometimes under pretence of looking at my irons to see if they  ----  safe, and would twist and turn them about so that i suffered intolerable pain, and blood flowed from my wounds made by these cruel irons.\n",
      "such abuse as he could give with h ----  tongue he dispensed freely.\n",
      "of course he was a coward, and he never d ---- d to come into one of the prisoner's rooms unless he was armed.\n",
      "this is a faithful photograph of the interior of the jail at easton, penn., as it  ----  a few years ago; there may have been some improvement since that time; for the sake of humanity, i hope there has been.\n",
      "after i had been in th ----  jail about six weeks, and had become well acquainted with my room-mates, i communicated to them one day, the result of my observation: \"there,\" said i, showing them a certain place in the wall, \"is a loose stone that with a little labor can be lifted out, and it will leave a hole large enough for us to get out of and go where we like.\"\n",
      "ex ---- ination elicited a unanimous verdict in favor of making the attempt.\n",
      "with no tools but a case knife we dug out the mortar on all sides of the stone doing the work by turns and covering the stone by hanging up an old blanket--which excited no suspicion, as it was at the head of one of the iron bedsteads--whenever the deputy or any of his men  ----  likely to visit us.\n",
      "the hole  ----  large enough to let a man through, and there was nothing for us to do but to crawl out one after the other and drop down a few feet into the yard.\n",
      "this yard  ----  surrounded by a board fence that could be easily surmounted.\n",
      "i intended to take the lead, after taking off my irons (which i had learned to do, and indeed, did every day, putting them on only when i  ----  liable to be \"inspected\") and after leaving these irons at the deputy's door, i intended to put myself on the jersey side of the river as speedily as possible.\n",
      "liberty  ----  within reach of every man in that room, and the night was set for the escape.\n"

      "\"well, i practice medicine, and take c ----  of the sick.\"\n",
      "waal, there's a woman up here to lake village, 'squire bla ---- dell's wife, who has had the dropsy more'n twelve years; been filling' all the time till they tell me she's bigger'n a hogshead now, and she's had a hundred doctors, and the more doctors she has the bigger she gets; what d' ye think of that now?\"\n",
      "i ans ---- d that i thought it was quite likely, and then turned away from the landlord to talk to my friends about our proposed sport for to-morrow, mentally making note of 'squire blaisdell's wife in lake village.\n",
      "after breakfast next morning we went out on the lake, cut holes in the ice, set our lines, and before dinner we had taken several fine trout and pickerel, the largest and finest of which we put into a box with ice, and sent as a present to president pierce, in  ---- hington.\n",
      "we had agreed, the night before, to f ---- h for him the first day, and to send him the best specimens we could from his native state.\n",
      "after dinner my friends started to go out on the ice again, and i told them \"i guess'd i wouldn't go with them, i had f ---- hed enough for that day.\"\n",
      "they ins ---- ted i should go, but i told them i preferred to take a walk and explore the country.\n",
      "i soon found mr. blaisdell's house, and as the servant who c ---- e to the door informed me that mr. blaisdell was not at home, i asked to see mrs. blaisdell, and was shown in to that lady.\n",
      "she was not quite the \"hogshead\" the landlord decl ---- d her to be, but she was one of the worst cases of dropsy i had ever seen.\n",
      "i introduced myself to her, told her my profession, and that i had called upon her in the hope of  ----  able to afford her some relief; that i wanted nothing for my services unless i could really benefit her.\n",
      "\"but there can be no harm in trying the forty-first;\" and as i said it i took from my vest pocket and held out in the palm of my hand some pills: \"here, mad ---- e, are some pills made from a simple blossom, which cannot possibly harm you, and which, i am sure, will do you a great deal of good.\"\n",
      "she exclaimed to her niece, who was in attendance upon her, \"this is my dre ---- !\n",
      "i dre ---- ed last night that my father appeared to me and told me that a stranger would come with a blossom in his hand; that he would offer it to me, and that if i would take it i should recover.\n",
      "\"surely,\" said mary, \"you  ----  not going to take this stranger's medicine without knowing anything about it, or him?\"\n",
      "\"i  ----  indeed; go and get the water.\"\n",
      "she took the medicine and then told me that her father, who had died two years ago, was a physician, and had c ---- fully attended to her case as long as he lived; but that she had a will of her own, and had sent far and near for other doctors, though with no good result.\n",
      "\"you have come to me,\" she continued, \"and although i  ----  not superstitious, your coming with a blossom in your hand, figuratively speaking, is so exactly in accordance with my dream, that i am going to put myself under your care.\"\n",
      "she then asked me if i lived in the neighborhood, and i told her no; that i had merely come up from boston with two friends to try a few days' f ---- hing through the ice on the lake.\n",
      "\"you can f ---- h to better purpose here, i think,\" she said; \"you can get plenty of practice in the villages and farm houses about here: at any rate, stay for the present and undertake my case, and i will pay you liberally.\"\n",
      "i went back to meredith bridge--i believe it  ----  now called laconia--and had another day's fishing with my friends.\n",
      "when they  ----  ready to pack up and return to boston, i astonished them by informing them that i should stay where i was for the present, perhaps for months, and that i believed i could find a good practice in meredith and adjoining places.\n",
      "the weeks wore on, and if mrs. blaisdell was a hogshead, as the meredith landlord said, when i first saw her, she soon bec ---- e a barrel under my treatment, and in four months she was entirely cured, and was as sound as any woman in the state.\n",
      "i had as much other business too as i could attend to, and  ----  very busy and happy all the time.\n",
      "in may i went to exeter, alternating  ---- tween there and portsmouth, and finding enough to do till the end of july.\n",
      "while i was in portsmouth on one of my last visits to that place, i received a call from a sea-captain by the n ---- e of brown, who told me that he had heard of my success in dropsical cases, and that i must go to newark, n. j., and see his daughter.\n",
      "\"pay,\" he said, \" ----  no object; i must go.\"\n",
      "i told him that i had early fin ---- hed my business in that vicinity, and that when i went to new york, as i proposed to do shortly, i would go over to newark and see his daughter.\n",
      "i marry a widow--six weeks of happiness--confiding a secret and the consequences--the widow's brother--sudden flight from newark--in hartford, conn.--my wife's sister betrays me--trial for big ---- y--sentenced to ten years imprisonment--i become a \"bobbin boy\"--a good friend--governor price visits me in prison--he pardons me--ten years' sentence fulfilled in seven months.\n",
      "with my matrimonial monomania it  ----  like putting my hand into the fire to go to a fresh place, where i should see fresh faces, and where fresh temptations would beset me.\n",
      "and when i went to newark, i went only as i supposed, to see a single patient; but captain brown prevailed upon me to stay to take c ----  of his daughter, and assured me that he and his friends would secure me a good practice.\n",
      "in two months i  ----  doing as well in my profession as i had ever done in any place where i had located.\n",
      "but, as ill luck, which, strangely enough, i then considered good luck, would have it, when i had been in newark some two months, i bec ---- e acquainted with a buxom, good-looking widow, mrs. elizabeth roberts.\n",
      "she was fair, fascinating, and had a goodly sh ----  of property.\n",
      "i fell into the sn ---- .\n",
      "she said she  ----  lonely; she sighed; she smiled, and i was lost.\n",
      "would that i had observed the elder weller's injunction: \"bev ----  of vidders;\" would that i had never seen the widow roberts, or rather that she had never seen me.\n",
      "eight weeks after we first met we  ----  married.\n",
      "we had a great wedding in her own house, and all her friends  ----  present.\n",
      "i  ----  in good practice with as many patients as i could attend to; she had a good home and we settled down to be very happy.\n",
      "for six weeks, only six weeks, i think we  ----  so.\n",
      "we might have  ----  so for six weeks, six months, six years longer; but alas!\n",
      "i was a fool i confided to her the secret of my first marriage, and separation, and she confided the s ---- e secret to her brother, a well-to-do wagon-maker in newark.\n",
      "so far as elizabeth was concerned, she said she didn't c ---- ; so long as the separation was mutual and final, since so many years had elapsed, and especially since i hadn't seen the woman for full six years, and was not supposed to know whether she was alive or dead, why, it was as good as a divorce; so reasoned elizabeth, and it was precisely my own reasoning, and the reasoning which had got me into numberless difficulties, to say nothing of jails and prisons.\n",
      "but the brother had his doubts about it, and c ---- e and talked to me on the subject several times.\n",
      "he threatened to have me arrested for big ---- y.\n",
      "then he had me brought  ---- fore a justice for threatening him, with a view to having me put under bonds to keep the peace.\n",
      "i employed a lawyer who managed my case so well that the justice concluded there  ----  no cause of action against me.\n",
      "but this lawyer informed me that the brother  ----  putting, even then, another rod in pickle for me, and that i had better clear out.\n",
      "i took h ----  advice, i went to the widow's house, packed my trunk, gathered together what money i could readily lay hands upon, and with about $300 in my pocket, i started for new york, staying that night at a hotel in courtland street.\n",
      "the prec ---- e object of my journey i do not think i knew myself; but i must have had some vague idea of persuading elizabeth to leave newark and join me in new york or elsewhere.\n",
      "i confess, too, that i  ----  more or less under the influence of liquor, and considerably more than less.\n",
      "however, no one would have noticed th ----  in my appearance or demeanor.\n",
      "i rode directly to eliza ---- th's door, hitched my horse, and went into the house.\n",
      "the moment my wife saw me she cried out: \"for god's sake get out of th ----  house and out of town as soon as you can; they have been watching for you ever since yesterday; they've got a warrant for your arrest; don't stay here one moment.\"\n",
      "i asked her if she was willing to follow me, and she said she would do so if she only d ---- d but her brother had made an awful row, and had sworn he would put me in prison anyhow; i had better go back to new york and await events.\n",
      "i started for the door, and was unhitching my horse, when the brother and a half dozen more  ----  upon me.\n",
      "this  ----  in the month of june, 1854. i went to the old exchange hotel in state street, and very soon acquired a good practice.\n",
      "indeed, it seems as if i  ----  always successful enough in my medical business--my mishaps have been in the matrimonial line.\n",
      "when i had been in hartford about three months, and was well settled, i thought i would go down to new york and see a married sister of elizabeth's, who was living there, and try to find out how matters  ----  going on over in newark.\n",
      "that i found out fully, if not exactly to my sat ---- faction, will appear anon.\n",
      "when i called at the sister's house, the servant told me she was out, but would be back in an hour; so i left my n ---- e, promising to call again.\n",
      "i returned again at one o'clock in the afternoon, and the sister  ----  in, but declined to see me.\n",
      "as i  ----  coming down the steps, a policeman who seemed to be lounging on the opposite side of the street, beckoned to me, and suspecting nothing, i crossed over to see what he wanted.\n",
      "he simply wanted to know my n ---- e, and when i gave it to him he informed me that i was his prisoner.\n",
      "this was for taking the pains to come down from hartford to inquire after the welf ----  of my wife!\n",
      "whose sister, the moment the servant told her i had been there, and would call again, had gone to the ne ---- st police station and given information, or made statements, which led to the setting of this latest trap for me.\n",
      "the policeman took me  ---- fore a justice who sent me to the tombs.\n",
      "i lay in a cell all night, and next morning elizabeth's brother, to whom the sister in new york had sent word that i was caged, c ---- e over from newark to see me.\n",
      "he said he felt sorry for me, but that he  ----  \"bound to put me through.\"\n",
      "he then asked me if i would go over to newark without a requ ---- ition from the governor of new jersey, and i told him i would not; whereupon he went away without saying another word, and i waited all day to hear from the lawyer to whom i had given twenty-five dollars, but he did not come.\n",
      "so next day when the brother c ---- e over and asked me the same question, i said i would go; wherein i was a fool; for i ought to have reflected that he had had twenty-four hours in which to get a requisition, and that he might in fact have made application for one already, without getting it, and every delay favored my chances of getting out.\n",
      "but i had no one to adv ---- e me, and so i went quietly with him and an officer to the ferry, where we crossed and went by cars to newark.\n",
      "i was at once taken before a justice, who, after a hearing of the case, bound me over, under bonds of only one thousand dollars, to take my trial for big ---- y.\n",
      "if i could have gone into the street i could have procured this comparatively trifling bail in half an hour; as it  ---- , after i was in jail i sent for a man whom i knew, and gave him my gold watch and one hundred dollars, all the money i had, to procure me bail, which he promised to do; but he never did a thing for me, except to rob me.\n",
      "a lawyer c ---- e to me and offered to take my case in hand for one hundred dollars, but i had not the money to give him.\n",
      "i then sent to new york for a lawyer whom i knew, and when he c ---- e to see me he took the same view of the case that elizabeth and i did; that is, that the long separation between my first wife and myself, and my presumed ignorance as to whether she was alive or dead, gave me full liberty to marry again.\n",
      "at least, he thought any court would consider it an extenuating circumstance, and he prom ---- ed to be present at my trial and aid me all he could.\n",
      "during that time i had almost daily quarrels with the jailor, who abused me sh ---- efully, and told me i ought to go to state prison and stay there for life.\n",
      "once he took hold of me and i struck him, for which i  ----  put in the dark cell forty-eight hours.\n",
      "at last c ---- e my trial.\n",
      "the court appointed counsel for me, for i had no money to fee a lawyer, and my new york friend  ----  on hand to advise and assist.\n",
      "i lad witnesses to show the length of time that had elapsed since my separation from my first wife, and we also raised the point as to whether the justice who married me,  ----  really a legal justice of the peace or not.\n",
      "i suppose all prisoners think so, but the judge charged against me in every point; the jury was out two hours, and then c ---- e in for advice on a doubtful question; the judge gave them another blast against me, and an hour after they came in with a verdict of \"guilty.\"\n",
      "i went back to jail and two days afterwards  ----  brought up for sentence which was--\"ten years at hard labor in the state prison at trenton.\"\n",
      "all th ----  for being courted and won by a widow!\n",
      "the day following, i  ----  taken in irons to trenton.\n",
      "the warden of the prison, who wanted to console me, said that, for the offence, my sentence  ----  an awful one, and that he didn't believe i would be obliged to serve out half of it.\n",
      "as i felt then, i did not  ---- lieve i should live out one-third of it.\n",
      "after i had gone through the routine of questions, and had been put in the prison uniform, a cap  ----  drawn down over my face, as if i was about to be hung, and i was led, thus blind-folded, around and around, evidently to confuse me, with regard to the interior of the prison--in case i might ever have any idea of breaking out.\n",
      "at last i  ----  brought to a cell door and the cap was taken off.\n",
      "there  ---- , properly no \"cells\" in this prison--at least i never saw any; but good sized rooms for two prisoners, not only to live in but to work in.\n",
      "i found myself in a room with a man who  ----  weaving carpets, and i was at once instructed in the art of winding yarn on bobbins for him--in fact, i was to be his \"bobbin-boy.\"\n",
      "i pursued th ----  monotonous occupation for two months, when i told the keeper i did not like that business, and wanted to try something that had a little more variety in it.\n",
      "whereupon he put me at the cane chair bottoming business, which gave me another room and another chum, and i remained at this work while i  ----  in the prison.\n",
      "in three weeks i could bottom one chair, while my mate  ----  bottoming nine or ten as his day's work; but i told the keeper i did not mean to work hard, or work at all, if i could help it.\n",
      "he  ----  a very nice fellow and he only laughed and let me do as i pleased.\n",
      "indeed, i could not complain of my treatment in any respect; i had a good clean room, good bed, and the f ----  was wholesome and abundant.\n",
      "but then, there  ----  that terrible, terrible sentence of ten long years of this kind of life, if i should live through it.\n",
      "after i had been in prison nearly seven months, one day a merchant tailor whom i well knew in newark, and who made my clothes, including my wedding suit when i married the widow roberts, c ---- e to see me.\n",
      "the legislature  ----  in session and he was a member of the senate.\n",
      "he knew all the circumstances of my case, and  ----  present at my trial.\n",
      "after the first salutation, he laughingly said: \"well, doctor, those  ----  not quite as nice clothes as i used to furnish you with.\"\n",
      "\"no,\" i replied, \"but perhaps they  ----  more durable.\"\n",
      "after some other chaff and chat, he made me tell him all about my first marriage and subsequent separation, and after talking awhile he went away, prom ---- ing to see me soon.\n",
      "i looked upon this only as a friendly visit, for which i  ----  grateful; and attached no great importance to it.\n",
      "but he c ---- e again in a few days, and after some general conversation, he told me that there was a movement on foot in my favor, which might bring the best of news to me; that he had not only talked with his friends in the legislature, and enlisted their sympathy and assistance, but he had laid the whole circumstances, from beginning to end, before governor price; that the governor would visit the prison shortly, and then i must do my best in pleading my own cause.\n",
      "in a day or two the governor c ---- e, and i had an opportunity to relate my story.\n",
      "i then appealed to the governor for his clemency; my sentence  ----  an outrageously severe one, and seemed almost prompted by private malice; i implored him to pardon me; i went down on my knees before him, and asked his mercy.\n",
      "he told me to be encouraged; that he would be in the pr ---- on again in a few days, and he would see me.\n",
      "i at once drew up a petition which my friend in the senate circulated in the legislature for signatures, and afterwards sent it to newark, securing some of the best n ---- es in that city.\n",
      "it was then returned to me, and two weeks afterwards when the governor c ---- e again to the prison i presented it to him, and he put it in his pocket.\n",
      "in two days' time, governor price sent my pardon into the pr ---- on.\n",
      "the warden c ---- e and told me of it, and said he would let me out in an hour.\n",
      "then c ---- e a keeper who once more put the cap over my face and led me around the interior--i was willingly led now--till he brought me to a room where he gave me my own clothes which i put on, and with a kind parting word, and five dollars from the warden, i was soon in the street, once more a free man.\n",
      "my sentence of ten years had been fulfilled by an impr ---- onment of exactly seven months.\n",
      "i went and called on governor price to thank him for h ----  great goodness towards me.\n",
      "with th ----  and the five dollars i received from the warden of the prison i started for new york.\n",
      "good resolutions--enjoying freedom--going after a crazy man--the old tempter in a new form--mary gordon--my new \"cousin\"--engaged again--visit to the old folks at home--another marriage--starting for ohio--change of plans--domestic quarrels--unpleasant stories about mary--bound over to keep the peace--another arrest for big ---- y--a sudden flight--secreted three weeks in a farm house--recaptured at concord--escaped once more--traveling on the underground railroad--in canada.\n",
      "it would seem as if, by th ----  time, i had had enough of miscellaneous marrying and the imprisonment that almost invariably followed.\n",
      "i had told governor price, when i first implored him for pardon, that if he would release me i would  ---- gin a new life, and endeavor to be in all respects a better man.\n",
      "i honestly meant to make every effort to  ----  so, and on my stay to new york i made numberless vows for my own future good behavior.\n",
      "i bound myself over, as it were, to keep the pace--my own peace and quiet especially--and bec ---- e my own surety.\n",
      "with those good resolutions i arrived in new york and went to my old hotel in courtland street, where i  ----  well known and was well received.\n",
      "my trunk, which i had left there sixteen months before, was safe, and i had a good suit of clothes on my back--the clothes i took off when i went to prison in trenton--and which were returned to me when i c ---- e away.\n",
      "i went to a friend who loaned me some money, and i remained two or three days in town to try my new-found freedom, going about the city, visiting places of  ---- usement, enjoying myself very much, and keeping, so far, the good resolutions i had formed.\n",
      "from new york i went to troy, and at the hotel where i stopped i bec ---- e acquainted with a woman who told me that her husband was in the insane asylum at brattleboro, vt. she was going to see him, and if he was fit to be removed, she proposed to take him home, with her.\n",
      "i told her of the success i had had in taking c ----  of two men at newbury and montgomery; and how i had traveled about the country with them, and with the most beneficial results to my patients.\n",
      "she  ----  much interested, inquired into the particulars, and finally thought the plan would be a favorable one for her husband.\n",
      "she asked me to go with her to see him, and said that if he was in condition to travel he should go about with me if he would; at any rate, if he c ---- e out of the asylum she would put him under my care.\n",
      "we went together to brattleboro, and the very day we arrived her husband  ----  taken in an apoplectic fit from which he did not recover.\n",
      "she carried home h ----  corpse, and i lost my expected patient.\n",
      "i also v ---- ited the adjoining villages, and in a few weeks i had a very good practice.\n",
      "nobody knew anything of my former history, my marriages or my misfortunes, and i  ----  doing well, with a daily increasing business.\n",
      "then c ---- e the old tempter in a new form, and my matrimonial monomania, which i hoped was cured forever, broke out afresh.\n",
      "one day, at the public house where i lived, i saw a fine girl from new h ---- pshire, with whom i became acquainted--so easily, so far as she was concerned--that i ought to have been warned to have nothing to do with her; but, as usual, in such cases, my common sense left me, and i was infatuated enough to fancy that i was in love.\n",
      "mary gordon  ----  the daughter of a farmer living near keene, n. h., and was a handsome girl about twenty years of age.\n",
      "she  ----  going, she told me, to visit some friends in bennington, and would be there about a month, during which time, if i was in that vicinity, she hoped i would come and see her.\n",
      "we parted very lovingly, and when she had been in bennington a few days she wrote to me, setting a time for me to visit her; but in business in brattleboro  ----  too good to leave, and i so wrote to her.\n",
      "whereupon, in another week, she c ---- e back to brattleboro and proposed to finish the remainder of her visit there, thus blinding her friends at home who would think she was all the while at bennington.\n"

      "the well-known character of the girl, my marriage to her, the brief honeymoon, the quarrels and the cause of the s ---- e, were all too tempting material not to be served up in a paragraph, and as i expected and feared, out came the whole story in the keene paper.\n",

      "all my past bitter experiences of wretched pr ---- on life urged me to flight.\n",
      "no stopping at the friendly farmer's, my former refuge, th ----  time; that would be too great a risk.\n",
      "i had plenty of money; but this kind of travelling is inexpensive, and, paying twenty-five cents for one or two meals a day, as i d ---- d to get them, and sleeping in barns or under haystacks for nothing, my purse did not materially diminish.\n",
      "i  ----  a good walker, and in the course of a week from the night when i left keene, i found myself in biddeford, maine.\n",

      "matters went on in this way for several weeks, when one evening i told her that i  ----  going next day to troy on business, and she said she wanted to go there to buy some goods, and that she would gladly take the opportunity to go with me, if i would let her.\n",
      "of course, i  ----  only too happy; and the next day i and my son, and she and one of the young women in her employ, who was to assist her in selecting goods, started for troy.\n",
      "when i called for her, just as we were leaving the house, the old lady, her mother, called out: \"marg ---- t, don't you get married before you come back.\"\n",
      "\"i guess i will,\" was marg ---- t's answer, and we went, a very jovial party of four, to troy and put up at the girard house, where we had dinner together, and drank a good deal of wine.\n",
      "i honestly think the two women could have laid me and my son under the table, and would have done it, if we had not looked out for ourselves; as it was, we all drank a great deal and  ----  very merry.\n",
      "we were in a room by ourselves, and when we had been there nearly an hour, it occurred to marg ---- t that it would be a good idea to humor the old lady's dry joke about the danger of our getting married during this visit to troy.\n",
      "we  ----  all just drunk enough to see that there was a joke in it, and we urged the boy to go.\n",
      "he went to the woman, who directed him to a stationer's opposite, and presently he c ---- e in with a blank marriage certificate.\n",
      "we called for pen and ink and he sat down and filled out the blank form putting in my n ---- e and margaret bradley's, signing it with some odd name i have forgotten as that of the clergyman performing the ceremony.\n",
      "he then signed his own n ---- e as a witness to the marriage, and the young woman who was with us also witnessed it with her signature.\n",
      "we had a great deal of fun over it, then more wine, and then it  ----  time for us to hurry to the depot to take the six o'clock train for rutland.\n",
      "reaching home at about eleven o'clock at night, we found the old lady up, and waiting for marg ---- t.\n",
      "we went in and marg ---- t's first words were: \"well, mother!\n",
      "i'm married; i told you, you know, i thought i should  ---- ; and here's my certificate.\"\n",
      "the mother expressed no surpr ---- e--she knew her daughter better than i did, then--but quietly congratulated her, while i said not a single word.\n",
      "my son went to see h ----  companion home, and, as i had not achieved this latest greatness, but had it thrust upon me, i and my new found \"wife\" went to our room.\n",
      "the next day i removed from the hotel to marg ---- t's house and remained there during my residence in rutland, she introducing me to her friends as her husband, and seeming to consider it an established fact.\n",
      "three weeks after this mock marriage, however, i told marg ---- t that i was going to travel about the state a while to sell my medicines, and that i might be absent for some time.\n",
      "she made no objections, and as i was going with my own te ----  she asked me to take some mantillas and a few other goods which were a little out of fashion, and see if i could not sell them for her.\n",

      "but it  ----  to be.\n",
      "it  ----  my fate to fall into the hands of another milliner.\n",
      "there was a milliner at rutland whose f ---- ily and, friends all believed to be my wife, though she knew she was not; and here in montpelier, was ready waiting, like a spider for a fly, another milliner who was about to enmesh me in the matrimonial net.\n",
      "i had not been in the place a week before i bec ---- e acquainted with eliza gurnsey.\n",
      "i could hardly help it, for she lived in the hotel where i stopped, and although she  ----  full thirty-five years old, she was altogether the most attractive woman in the house.\n",
      "she  ----  agreeable, good-looking, intelligent, and what the vernacular calls \"smart.\"\n",
      "at all events, she  ----  much too smart for me, as i soon found out.\n",
      "she had a considerable millinery establishment which she and her younger sister carried on, employing several women, and she  ----  reputed to be well off.\n",
      "strange as it may seem in the light of after events, she actually belonged to the church and  ----  a regular attendant at the services.\n",
      "but no woman in town  ----  more talked about, and precisely what sort of a woman she was may be estimated from the fact that i had known her but little more than a week, when she proposed that she, her sister and i should go to saratoga together, and have a good time for a day or two.\n",

      "we rode about, got drunk, went to the lake, c ---- e back to the hotel, and the second day we were there, eliza sent her sister for a presbyterian minister, whose address she had somehow secured, and this minister came to the hotel and married us.\n",
      "i presume i consented, i don't know, for i  ----  too much under the effect of liquor to know much of anything.\n",

      "but the whole was like a dre ----  to me; it was the plot of an infamous woman to endeavor to make herself respectable by means of a marriage, no matter to whom or how that marriage was effected.\n",
      "meanwhile, the montpelier papers had the whole story, one of them publishing a glowing account of my elopement with miss gurnsey, and the facts of our marriage at saratoga  ----  duly chronicled.\n",
      "th ----  paper fell into the hands of miss bradley, at rutland, and as she claimed to be my wife, and had parted with me only a little while before, when i went out to peddle medicines and millinery, her feelings can be imagined.\n",
      "i had not been back from saratoga half an hour before i was arrested in the public house in montpelier and taken before a magistrate, on complaint of miss bradley, of rutland, that i was guilty of big ---- y.\n",
      "the ex ---- ination was a long one, and as the facts which were then shown appeared afterwards in my trial they need not be noted now.\n",
      "i had two first-rate lawyers, but for all that, and with the plainest showing that marg ---- t bradley had no claim whatever to be considered my wife, i was bound over in the sum of three thousand dollars to appear for trial, and was sent to jail.\n",
      "there  ----  a tremendous excitement about the matter, and the whole town seemed interested.\n",
      "to jail i went, eliza going with me, and insisting upon staying; but the jailer would not let her, nor  ----  she permitted to visit me during my entire stay there, at least she got in to see me but once.\n",
      "i made every effort to get bail, but  ----  unsuccessful.\n",
      "eight long weary months elapsed before my trial c ---- e on, and all this while i was in jail.\n",
      "the bradley woman knew she was no more married to me than she was to the man in the moon; but she swore stoutly that we  ----  actually wedded according to the certificate.\n",
      "on the other hand, my son swore to all the facts about the troy spree, and his buying and filling out the certificate, which showed for itself that, excepting the signature of the young woman who also witnessed it, it  ----  entirely in henry's handwriting.\n",
      "i should have got along well enough so far as the bradley woman was concerned; but the prosecution had been put in possession of all the facts relative to my first and worst marriage, and the whole matter c ---- e up in this case.\n",
      "the d ---- trict attorney had sent everywhere, as far even as illinois, for witness with regard to that marriage.\n",
      "it seemed as if all vermont  ----  against me.\n",
      "a few days after i returned to jail a friend of mine managed to furn ---- h me with files and saws, and i went industriously to work at the gratings of my window to saw my way out.\n",
      "i could work only at night, when the keepers  ----  away, and i covered the traces of my cuttings by filling in with tallow.\n",
      "but just at that time the governor of the state, fletcher, made a v ---- it to the jail.\n",
      "he assured me, after hearing all the circumstances, that if i should  ----  convicted and sentenced, he would surely pardon me in the course of six or eight weeks.\n",
      "trusting in th ----  promise, i made no further effort to escape though i could have done so easily any night; but rather than run the risk of recapture, and a heavier sentence if i should be convicted, i awaited the chances of the court, and looked beyond for the clemency of the governor.\n",
      "well, finally my case c ---- e up in the supreme court.\n",
      "it only occupied a day, and the result  ----  that i was sentenced for three years in the state prison.\n",
      "i  ----  remanded to jail, and five days from that time i was taken from montpelier to windsor.\n",

      "we arrived at windsor and i  ----  safely inside of the prison at three o'clock in the afternoon.\n",
      "warden harlow met me with a joke, to the effect that, had it not been for my handcuffs he should have taken the officer who brought me, to be the prisoner, i  ----  so much the better dressed of the two.\n",
      "he  ----  sorry, and surprised, he said, to see a man of my appearance brought to such a place for such a crime; he could not understand how a person of my evident intelligence should get into such a scrape.\n",
      "i told him that he understood it as well as i did, at all events; that i could not conceive why i should get into these difficulties, one after the other; but that i believed i was a crazy man on this one subject--matrimonial monomania; that when i had gone through with one of these scrapes, and had suffered the severe punishment that was almost certain to follow, the whole was like a dre ----  to me--a nightmare and nothing more.\n",
      "with regard to what  ----  before me in this prison i should try and behave myself, and make the best of the situation; but i notified the warden that i did not mean to do one bit of work if i could help it.\n",
      "he took me inside, where my fine clothes  ----  taken away, and i. was dressed in the usual particolored prison uniform.\n",
      "i  ----  told the rules, and was warned that if i did not observe them it would go hard with me.\n",
      "then followed twenty-four hours solitary confinement, and the next afternoon i was taken from my cell to a shop in which scythe snaths  ----  made.\n",
      "it had transpired during my trial at montpelier, that when i  ----  a young man, i was a blacksmith by trade.\n",
      "this information had been transmitted to prison and i  ----  at once put to work making heel rings.\n",
      "it was some years since i had worked at a forge and handled a h ---- mer.\n",
      "consequently, in three or four days, my hands  ----  terribly blistered, and as the warden happened to come into the shop, i showed them to him, and quietly told him that i would do that work no longer.\n",
      "i answered that he might kill me, or punish me in any way he pleased, but he could not make me do that kind of labor, and i threw down my h ---- mer and refused to work a moment longer.\n",
      "he approached me in a kindly way, and i showed my bl ---- tered hands to him.\n",
      "he thought that  ----  the way to \"toughen\" me.\n",
      "i thought not, and said so, and, moreover, told him i would never make another heel ring in that pr ---- on, and i never did.\n",
      "he sent me to my cell and i stayed there a week, till my hands  ----  well.\n",
      "then the deputy c ---- e to me and asked me if i was willing to learn to hew out scythe snaths in the rough for the shavers, who finished them?\n",
      "i went into the shop and  ----  shown how the work was to be done.\n",
      "every man  ----  expected to hew out fifty snaths in a day.\n",
      "in three or four days the shop-keeper c ---- e and overlooked me while i was working in my bungling way, and said if i couldn't do better than that i must clear out of his shop and do something else.\n",
      "my reply  ----  that i did not understand the business, and had no desire or intention to learn it.\n",
      "he sent for the deputy warden, who c ---- e and expressed the opinion that i could not do anything.\n",
      "i said i  ----  willing to do anything i could understand.\n",
      "\"well, some things, marrying for instance,\"  ----  my answer.\n",
      "\"i want no joking or blackguard ---- m about this matter,\" said the deputy; \"them simple fact is, you've got to work; if you don't we'll make you.\"\n",
      "so i kept on at hewing, making no improvement, and in a day or two more the shopkeeper undertook to show me how the work should  ----  done.\n",
      "\"you don't try; and i have a good mind to pun ---- h you.\"\n",
      "the moment the shop-keeper said it i dropped the snath, raised my axe, and told him that if he c ---- e one step nearer to me i would make mincemeat of him.\n",
      "he thought it was advisable to stay where he was; but one of the prison-keepers was in the shop, and as he c ---- e toward me i warned him that he had better keep away.\n",
      "all the men in the shop  ----  ready to break out in insubordination; when i threatened the shop keeper and the guard, they cheered; the deputy warden was soon on the ground; he stood in the doorway a moment, and then, in a kind tone called me to him.\n",
      "he told me that there  ----  no use of \"making a muss\" there, it incited the other prisoners to insubordination, and was sure to bring severe punishment upon myself.\n",
      "\"but if you  ----  going to put me into that black hole of yours,\" i exclaimed, \"i won't go; you'll have to draw me there or kill me on the way.\"\n",
      "he promised he would not put me in the dungeon, he  ----  only going to put me in my cell, he said, and to my cell i went, willingly enough, and stayed there a week, during which time i suppose everyone of my shopmates thought i was in the dungeon, undergoing severe punishment for my rebellions conduct.\n",
      "i had learned now the worst lesson which a prisoner can learn--that is, that my keepers  ----  afraid of me.\n",
      "to a limited extent, it is true, i  ----  now my own master and keeper.\n",
      "in a few days deputy morey c ---- e to me and asked me if i was \"willing\" to come out and work.\n",
      "i  ----  sick of solitary confinement, and longed to see the faces of men, even prisoners: so i told him if i could get any work i could do i was willing to try it, and would do as well as i knew how.\n",
      "i told him i had some taste for it, and if he would show me h ----  job i would let him see what i could do.\n",
      "the fact is, i was a very fair  ---- ateur locksmith, and had quite a fondness for fixing, picking, and fussing generally over locks.\n",
      "accordingly, when he gave me a lock to work upon to make it \"play easier,\" as he described it, i did the job so satisfactorily that i had nearly every lock in the prison to take off and operate upon, if it  ----  nothing more than to clean and oil one.\n",
      "th ----  business occupied my entire time and attention for nearly three months.\n",
      "then i repaired iron bedsteads, did other iron work, and i  ----  the general tinker of the prison.\n",
      "it c ---- e into my head, however, one day, that i might as well do nothing.\n",
      "the prison f ----  was indescribably bad, almost as bad as the jail fare at easton.\n",
      "we lived upon the poorest possible salt  ---- ef for dinner, varied now and then with plucks and such stuff from the slaughter houses, with nothing but bread and rye coffee for breakfast and supper, and mush and molasses perhaps twice a week.\n",
      "i  ----  daily abused, too, by the warden, his deputy, and his keepers.\n",
      "they looked upon me as an ugly, insubordinate, refractory, rebellious rascal, who  ----  ready to kill any of them, and, worst of all, who would not work.\n",
      "it  ----  a wretched dark hole, with a little dirty straw in one corner to lie upon.\n",
      "my entire food and drink  ----  bread and water.\n",
      "his face  ----  the only one i saw during the livelong day.\n",
      "day and night were alike to me; i lost the run of time; but at long intervals, once in eight or ten days, i suppose, the deputy c ---- e to this hole and asked me if i would come out and work.\n",
      "i always ans ---- d, \"never!\"\n",
      "i lay there till my hips  ----  worn raw.\n",
      "no human being can conceive the agony, the suffering endured in th ----  dungeon.\n",
      "at last i  ----  nearly blind, and was scarcely able to stand up.\n",
      "one day the door opened and i  ----  ordered out.\n",
      "they  ----  obliged to bring me out; i was so reduced that i was but the shadow of myself.\n",
      "there  ----  no use in asking me if i would go to work then; i was just alive.\n",
      "a few days in my own cell, in the daylight, and with something  ---- side bread and water to eat, partially restored me.\n",
      "i was then taken into the shop where the snaths  ----  finished by scraping and varnishing, the lightest part of the work, but i would not learn, would not do, would not try to do anything at all.\n",
      "the whole struggle nearly killed me, but i  ---- at them.\n",
      "i  ----  turned into the halls and told to do what i could, which, i knew well enough, meant what i would.\n",

      "i  ----  what theatrical managers call a general utility man, and, not at all strangely, for it is human nature, now that i could do what i pleased, i pleased to do a great deal, and was tolerably useful, and far more agreeable than i had been in the past.\n",
      "there  ----  a young fellow, twenty-two years of age, in one of the cells, serving out a sentence of six years.\n",
      "when i  ----  sweeping around i used to stop and talk to him every day.\n",
      "one day he  ----  missing.\n",
      "he had been supposed to be sick or asleep for several hours, for app ---- ntly lie lay in bed, and was lying very still.\n",
      "but that  ----  only an ingeniously constructed dummy.\n",
      "the young man himself had made a hole under h ----  bed into an adjoining vacant cell, the door of which stood open.\n",
      "he had crawled through h ----  hole, come out of the vacant cell door, and gone up to the prison garret, where he found some old pieces of rope.\n",
      "he  ----  never recaptured.\n",
      "i  ----  accused of imparting this valuable information, and i suffered four weeks' confinement in that horrible dungeon on the mere suspicion.\n",
      "th ----  made ten weeks in all of my prison-life in a hole in which i suffered so that i hoped i should die there.\n",
      "one of the prisoners was a desperate man, n ---- ed hall.\n",
      "he  ----  a convicted murderer, and was sentenced for life.\n",
      "he too, worked about in the pr ---- on and the yards, dragging or carrying a heavy ball and chain.\n",
      "when bundles of snaths  ----  to be carried from one shop to the other in the various processes of finishing, hall had to do it, and to carry his ball and chain as well, so that he was loaded like a pack-horse.\n",
      "no pack-horse  ----  ever so abused.\n",
      "of course he  ----  ugly; the wardens and the keepers knew it, and generally kept away from him.\n",
      "i talked with him more than once, and he told me that with  ---- tter treatment he should be a better man.\n",
      "\"look at the loads which  ----  put on me every day,\" he would say; as if this ball and chain were not as much as i can carry; and this for life, for life!\n",
      "one day when hall and i were working together in the prison, deputy warden morey c ---- e in and said something to him, and in a moment the man sprung upon him.\n",
      "he had secured somehow, perhaps he had picked it up in the yard, a pocket knife, and with th ----  he stabbed the warden, striking him in the shoulder, arm, and where he could.\n",
      "morey  ----  a man sixty-five years of age, and he made such resistance as he could, crying out loudly for help.\n",
      "i turned, ran to hall, and with one blow of my fist knocked him nearly senseless; then help c ---- e and we secured the mad man.\n",
      "morey  ----  profuse in protestations of gratitude to me for saving his life.\n",
      "there  ----  a great excitement over this attempt to murder the deputy, and for a few hours, with wardens and keepers, i was a hero.\n",
      "i had been in the prison more than a year, and  ----  generally regarded as one of the worst prisoners, one of the \"hardest cases;\" a mere chance had suddenly made me one of the most commendable men within those dreary walls.\n",
      "as for hall, he  ----  taken to the dungeon and securely chained by the feet to a ring in the center of the stone floor.\n",
      "there is no doubt whatever that the man  ----  a raving maniac.\n",
      "he howled night and day so that he could be heard everywhere in the pr ---- on--\"murder, murder!\n",
      "they  ----  murdering me in this black hole; why don't they take me out and kill me?\"\n",
      "the warden said it could not be helped; that the man must be kept there; he  ----  dangerous to himself and others; the dark cell was the only place for him.\n",
      "so hall stayed there and howled, h ----  cries growing weaker from day to day; by-and-by we heard him only at intervals, and after that not at all.\n",
      "one morning there  ----  a little knot of men around the open dungeon door, the deputy warden and two or three keepers.\n",
      "i went into the cell and in a few minutes i unfastened h ----  feet from the ring; then i took the shackles off his limbs.\n",
      "i thought he held his legs very stiff, but knew he  ----  obstinate, and only wondered he was so quiet.\n",
      "the blood from his mouth and nostrils had clotted on the lower part of his face, and his wild eyes, fixed and glassy,  ----  staring at the top wall of the dungeon.\n",
      "he must have  ----  dead several hours.\n",
      "the deputy and the rest knew he was dead--the man who carried in the bread and water told them--me it c ---- e with a shock from which i did not soon recover.\n",
      "they buried hall in the little graveyard which  ----  in the yard of the prison.\n",
      "an episcopal clergyman, who  ----  chaplain of the prison, read the burial service over him.\n",
      "the prisoners  ----  brought out to attend the homely funeral.\n",
      "the ball and chain, all the personal property left by hall,  ----  put aside for the next murderer sentenced for life, or for the next \"ugly\" prisoner.\n",
      "\"if i  ----  only treated better, and not abused so, i should be a better man.\"\n",
      "th ----  is what hall used to say to me whenever he had an opportunity.\n",
      "the last and worst and best in that pr ---- on had been done for him now.\n",
      "from the day when i rescued morey from the hands of hall, h ----  whole manner changed towards me, and he treated me with great kindness, frequently bringing me a cup of tea or coffee, and something good to eat.\n",
      "he also prom ---- ed to present the circumstances of the hall affair to the governor, and to urge my pardon, but i do not think he ever did so, at least i heard nothing of it.\n",
      "when i pressed the matter upon morey's attention he said it would do no good till i had served out half my sentence, and then he would see what could  ----  done.\n",
      "but during the last two years i had very little to complain of except the loss of my li ---- rty.\n",
      "i  ----  put into the cook shop where i could get better food, and i did pretty much what i pleased.\n",
      "by general consent i  ----  let alone.\n",
      "they had found out that ill usage only made me \"ugly,\" while kindness made me at least  ---- have myself.\n",
      "and so the three weary years of my confinement  ----  on to an end.\n",
      "on the tr ---- p.\n",
      "the day of my deliverance--out of clothes--sharing with a beggar--a good friend--tr ---- ping through the snow--weary walks--trusting to luck--comfort at concord--at meredith bridge--the blaisdells--last of the \"blossom\" business--making money at portsmouth--revisiting windsor--an astonished warden--making friends of old enemies--inspecting the prison--going to port jervis.\n",
      "at last the happy day of my deliverance c ---- e.\n",
      "the penalty for pretending to marry one milliner and for being married by another milliner  ----  paid.\n",
      "my sentence  ----  fulfilled.\n",
      "i had looked forward to th ----  day for months.\n",
      "of all my jail and prison life in different states, this in vermont  ----  the hardest, the most severe.\n",
      "my obstinacy, no doubt, did much at first to enhance my sufferings, and it  ----  the accident only of my saving morey's life that made the last part of my imprisonment a little more tolerable.\n",
      "when i  ----  preparing to go, it was discovered that the fine suit of clothes i wore into the prison had been given by mistake or design to some one else, and my silk hat and calf-skin boots had gone with the clothes.\n",
      "i would have gone out into the world in rags--my liberty  ----  all i wanted then.\n",
      "the warden gave me one of h ----  own old coats, a ragged pair of pantaloons, and a new pair of brogan shoes.\n",
      "he also gave me three dollars, which  ----  precisely a dollar a year for my services, and this was more than i ever meant to earn there.\n",

      "i tr ---- ped through the wet snow ankle deep, but made nearly forty miles before night, and then came to a public house which i knew well.\n",

      "this  ----  the fruit which my \"blossom\" of years before brought at last.\n",
      "i saw mrs. bla ---- dell, but she said she could do nothing for me.\n",
      "of all my bills in that vicinity, with a week's dunning, i collected only three dollars; but a good friend of mine, sheriff hill, went around and succeeded in making up a purse of twenty dollars which he put into my hands just as i  ----  going away.\n",
      "my old landlord wanted nothing for my week's board; all he wanted  ----  to know \"if i ever cured anybody;\" and when i told him i did, \"sometimes\" he insisted upon my taking more of his medicine, and he put up a good bottle of it for me to carry with me on my journey.\n",
      "with my twenty dollars i went to portsmouth, where i speedily felt that i was  ---- ong old and true friends.\n",
      "i had not been there a day before i was called upon to take c ----  of a young man who was sick, and after a few weeks charge of him i received in addition to my board and expenses, three hundred dollars.\n",
      "i  ----  now enabled to clothe myself handsomely, and i did so and went to newburyport, where i remained several weeks and made a great deal of money.\n",
      "in the spring i went to white river junction, and while i  ----  in the hotel taking a drink with some friends, who should come into the bar-room but the lake village tailor from whom i had borrowed the overcoat which i had even then on my back.\n",
      "i  ----  about to thank him for his kindness to me when he took me aside and said reproachfully: \"doctor, you wore away my overcoat and this is it, i think.\"\n",
      "didn't john bla ---- dell pay you for the coat?\n",
      "\"he never said a word to me about it,\"  ----  the reply.\n",
      "i told the tailor the circumstances; i did not like to let him to know that i had then about seven hundred dollars in my pocket; i wished to appear poor as long as there  ----  a chance to collect any of my meredith and lake village bills; so i offered him three dollars to take back the coat.\n",
      "he willingly consented and that  ----  the last of the \"blossom\" business with the blaisdells.\n",
      "i  ----  bound not to leave this part of the country without revisiting windsor, and i went there, stopping at the best house in the town, and, i fear, \"putting on airs\" a little.\n",
      "i had suffered so much in this place that i wanted to see if there  ----  any enjoyment to be had there.\n",
      "satisfaction there  ---- , certainly--the satisfaction one feels in going back under the most favorable circumstances, to a spot where he has endured the very depths of misery.\n",
      "after a good dinner i set out to v ---- it the prison.\n",
      "here  ----  the very spot in the street where, only a few months before, i, a ragged beggar, had divided my mere morsel of money with the poor woman from rutland.\n",
      "i had recovered my health which bad food, ill usage, and imprisonment had broken down, and  ----  in the best physical condition.\n",
      "the warden's old coat and pantaloons had  ----  exchanged for the finest clothes that money would buy.\n",
      "i had seen many of my old friends, and knew that they  ----  still my friends, and i was fully restored to my old position.\n",
      "my three years' imprisonment  ----  only a blank in my existence; i had begun life again and afresh, precisely where i left off before i fell into the hands of the two vermont milliners.\n",
      "all this  ----  very pleasant to reflect upon; but do not believe i thought even then, that the reason for this change in my circumstances, and changes for the better, was simply because i had minded my business and had let women alone.\n",
      "when i called on warden harlow, and courteously asked to be shown about the prison, he got up and was ready to comply with my request, when he looked me full in the face and started back in  ---- azement: \"well, i declare!\n",
      " ----  this you?\"\n",
      "\"yes, warden harlow; but i want you to understand that while i  ----  here i do not intend to do a bit of work, and you can't make me.\n",
      "the warden laughed heartily, and sent for deputy morey who c ---- e in to \"see a gentleman,\" and was much astonished to find the prisoner, who, two years before, had saved his life from the hands and knife of the madman hall.\n",
      "i spent a very pleasant hour with my old enemies, and i took occasion to give them a hint or two with regard to the proper treatment of pr ---- oners.\n",
      "i then made the rounds of the pr ---- on, and went into the dungeon where i had passed so many wretched hours for weeks at a time.\n",
      "the warden and his deputy congratulated me upon my improved appearance and prospects, and hoped that my whole future c ---- er would be equally prosperous.\n",
      "i stayed three or four days in windsor, finding it really a charming place, and i  ----  almost sorry to leave it.\n",
      "but my only purpose in going there, that is to revisit the prison,  ----  accomplished, and i started for new york, and went from there to port jervis, where i met my eldest son.\n",
      "starting to see sarah--the long separation--what i learned about her--her drunken husband--change of plan--a suddenly--formed scheme--i find sarah's son--the first interview--resolve to kidnap the boy--remonstrances of my son henry--the attempt--a desperate struggle--the rescue--arrest of henry--my flight into pennsylvania--sending ass ---- tance to my son--return to port jervis--bailing henry--his return to belvidere--he is bound over to be tried for kidnapping--my folly.\n",
      "after i had been in port jervis three or four days i matured a plan that had long been forcing in my mind, and that  ---- , to try and see sarah scheimer once more, or at least to find out something about her and about our son.\n",
      "the boy, if he  ----  living, must be about ten years of age.\n",
      "i had never seen him; nor, since the night when i  ----  taken out of bed and carried to the easton jail had i ever seen sarah, or even heard from her, except by the message the methodist minister brought to me from her the day after i was released from jail.\n",
      "in the long interval i had married the newark widow, and had served a brief term in the new jersey state prison for doing it; i had married mary gordon, in new h ---- pshire, and had run away, not only from her, but from constables and the prison in that state; the mock marriage with the rutland woman at troy, and the altogether too real marriage with the montpelier milliner had followed; i had spent three wretched years in the vermont prison at windsor; and numerous other exciting adventures had checkered my career.\n",
      "what had happened to sarah and her son during all th ----  while?\n",
      "there  ----  not a week in the whole time since our sudden separation when i had not thought of sarah; and now i was near her old home, with means at my command, leisure on my hands, and i was determined to know something about her and the child.\n",
      "so long a time had elapsed and i  ----  so changed in my personal appearance that i had little fear of being recognized by any one in pennsylvania or the adjoining part of new jersey, who would molest me.\n",
      "the old matters must have been pretty much forgotten by all but the very few who  ----  immediately interested in them.\n",
      "it  ----  safe to make the venture at all events, and, i resolved to make the venture to see and learn what i could.\n",
      "i had the idea in my mind that if sarah  ----  alive and well, and free, i should be able to induce her to fulfil her promise to come to me, and that we might go somewhere and settle down and live happily together.\n",
      "i did not communicate a word of all th ----  to my son henry.\n",
      "i told him i  ----  going to new jersey to visit some friends, to look for business, and i would like to have him accompany me.\n",
      "i had no friends to visit, no business to do, except to see sarah--the de ---- st and best--loved of all my wives.\n",
      "when we reached water gap i found an old acquaintance in the landlord of the hotel, and i told him where i  ----  going, and what i hoped to do.\n",
      "he knew the scheimers, knew all that had happened eleven years before, and he told me that sarah had married again, seven years ago, and  ----  the mother of two more children.\n",
      "she lived on a farm, half a mile from oxford, and her husband who had married her for her money, and had been urged upon her by her p ---- nts, was a shiftless, worthless, drunken fellow.\n",
      "the boy--my boy-- ----  alive and well, and was with his mother.\n",
      "th ----  intelligence changed, or rather made definite my plan.\n",
      "sarah  ----  nothing to me now.\n",
      "the boy  ----  everything.\n",
      "i must see him, and if he  ----  what he was represented to be, a bright little fellow, i determined that he should no longer remain in the hands and under the control of his drunken step-father, but i would carry him away with me if i could.\n",
      "it  ----  nearly noon when we arrived at oxford, and going to my old quarters, i found that \"boston yankee,\" had long since left the place.\n",
      "there was a new landlord, and i saw no f ---- iliar faces about the house; all was new and strange to me.\n",
      "it was noon now, and fifty or more boys  ----  trooping out of school.\n",
      "i c ---- fully scanned the throng.\n",
      "the old proverb has it that it  ----  a wise child who knows its own father; but it is not so difficult for a father to know his own children.\n",
      "the moment i put my eyes on sarah's son, i knew him; he  ----  the very image of me; i could have picked him out of a thousand.\n",
      "i beckoned to the boy and he c ---- e to me.\n",
      "he was b ---- foot; and his very toes betrayed him, for they \"overrode\" just as mine did; but his face was enough and would have been evidence of his identity as my son in any court in christendom.\n",
      "\"do you know what was your mother's n ---- e before she was married?\"\n",
      "\"yes sir, it  ----  sarah scheimer.\"\n",
      "\"do you know that the man with whom you live  ----  not your rather?\"\n",
      "\"oh, yes, sir, i know that; mother always told me so; but she never told me who my father  ---- .\"\n",
      "\"my son,\" said i taking him in my arms, \"i  ----  your father; wait about here a few minutes till i can go and get my horse and carriage, and i will take you to ride.\"\n",
      "i ran over to the hotel; ordered my horse to be brought to the door at once, got into the wagon with henry and told him that sarah scheimer's boy  ----  just across the way, and that i was going to carry him off with us.\n",
      "henry implored me not to do it, and said it  ----  dangerous.\n",
      "i did not know that at that moment, men who had noticed my excited manner, and who knew i was \"up to something,\"  ----  watching me from the hotel piazza.\n",
      "i drove over where the boy  ----  waiting, called him to me, and henry held the reins while i put out my hands to pull the boy into the carriage.\n",
      "two of the men who were watching me c ---- e at once, one of them taking the horse by the head, and the other coming to me and demanding: \"what are you going to do with that boy?\"\n",
      "\"take him with me; he  ----  my son.\"\n",
      "i also seized the lad who began to scre ---- .\n",
      "all the while the other man  ----  shouting for assistance.\n",
      "the boy  ----  roughly torn from me, in spite of my efforts to retain him.\n",
      "henry was thoroughly alarmed; and while the mob  ----  trying to pull us also out of the carriage he whipped the horse till he sprang through the crowd and was well off in a moment.\n",
      "we  ----  not half an hour in reaching belvidere.\n",
      "there i stopped to breathe the horse a few minutes, and henry insisted that he  ----  starving, and must have something to eat; he would go into the hotel he said, and get some dinner.\n",
      "i told him it  ----  madness to do it; but he would not move an inch further on the road till he had some dinner.\n",
      "he went into the dining room, and i paced up and down the piazza, nervous, anxious, fearing pursuit, dreading capture, well knowing what would happen when those jerseymen should get hold of me and find out who i  ---- .\n",
      "but he thought i  ----  only trying to frighten him so as to hurry him away from his dinner, and get him on the road, and he paid no attention to my summons.\n",
      "i knew that i  ----  the man who was wanted, and, without waiting for henry, i jumped into my wagon and drove off.\n",
      "the moment i left, my pursuers  ----  at the door.\n",
      "i turned my horse's head towards the  ---- lvidere bridge.\n",
      "all the country about there was as f ---- iliar to me as the county i was born in.\n",
      "i knew every road, and i had no fear of  ----  caught.\n",
      "once across the bridge and in pennsylvania, and i  ----  comparatively safe, unless i myself should be kidnapped as i was at midnight, only a little way from this very spot, eleven years before.\n",
      "here  ----  an opportunity now to rest and reflect.\n",
      "was i never to see the end of the scrapes that f ---- ily would get me into, or which i was to get myself into, on account of the scheimers?\n",
      "he did not even know of the contemplated abduction till five minutes before it  ----  attempted, and then he protested against it.\n",
      "nothing showed so completely the consciousness of h ----  own entire innocence in the matter, as the coolness with which he sat down to his dinner in belvidere, and insisted upon remaining when i warned him of our danger.\n",
      "these facts shown, any mag ---- trate before whom he might be taken, must let him go at once.\n",
      "i thought, perhaps, if i waited a few hours where i was, he would be sure to rejoin me, and we could then return to port jervis without sarah's son to be sure; but, otherwise, no worse off than we  ----  when we set out on this ill-starred expedition in the morning.\n",
      "all this seemed so plain to me that i sent over to belvidere for a lawyer, who soon c ---- e across the bridge to see me, and to him i narrated the whole circumstances of the case from, beginning to end.\n",
      "i asked him if i had not a right to carry off the boy whom i knew to  ----  my own?\n",
      "his reply  ----  that he would not stop to discuss that question; all he knew was that there was a great hue and cry after me for kidnapping the boy; that my son was seized and held for aiding and abetting in the attempted abduction; and he advised me, as a friend, to leave that part of the country as soon as possible.\n",
      "he thought, considering how little, and that little involuntarily, my son had to do with the matter, he might  ----  got off; he would do all he could for him anyhow.\n",
      "he then returned to  ---- lvidere, and i took the road north.\n",
      "when i arrived at port jervis i detailed to my landlord the whole occurrences of the day--what i had tried to do, and how miserably i had failed, and asked him what  ----  to be done next.\n",
      "the day following i received a letter from the belvidere lawyer informing me that henry had been ex ---- ined, had been bound over in the sum of three hundred dollars to take his trial on a charge of kidnapping, and he was then in the county jail.\n",
      "i at once showed th ----  letter to the landlord, and he offered to go down with another man to belvidere and see about the bail.\n",
      "i gave him three hundred dollars, which he took with him and put into the bands of a resident there who bec ---- e bail, and in a day or two henry came back with them to port jervis.\n",
      "my son  ----  frantic; he had been roughly treated; and to think, he said, that he should be thrust into the common jail and kept there two days with all sorts of scoundrels, when he had done actually nothing!\n",
      "he would go back there, stand h ----  trial, and prove his innocence, if he died for it.\n",
      "he reproached me for attempting to carry off the boy against h ----  advice and warning; he knew we should into trouble; but he would show them that he had nothing to do with it; that's what he would do.\n",
      "now this  ----  precisely what i did not wish to have him do.\n",
      "a trial of th ----  case, even if henry should come off scott free, would be certain to revive the whole of the old scheimer story, which had nearly died away, and which i had no desire to have brought before the public again in any way whatever.\n",
      "the bail bond i  ----  willing, eager even to forfeit, if that would end the matter.\n",
      "but henry  ----  sure they couldn't touch him, and he meant to have the three hundred dollars returned to me.\n",
      "seeing how sensitive the boy  ----  on the subject, and how bent he was on proving his innocence, i thought it best to draw him away from the immediate locality, and so, in the course of a week, i persuaded him to go to new york with me, and we afterward went to maine for a few weeks to sell my medicines.\n",
      "this maine trip was a most lucrative one, which was very fortunate, for the money i made there, to the  ---- ount of several hundred dollars, was shortly needed for purposes which i did not anticipate when i put the money by.\n",
      "we returned to new york, and i supposed that henry had given up all idea of attempting to \"prove h ----  innocence;\" indeed we had no conversation about the kidnapping affair for several weeks.\n",
      "one day i c ---- e back to the hotel, and, inquiring for him, was told at the office he had left word for me that he had gone to belvidere.\n",
      "a letter from him a day or two afterward confirmed th ---- , to me, unhappy intelligence.\n",
      "the time  ----  near at hand for his trial, and he had gone and given himself up to the authorities.\n",
      "he wrote to me again that he had sent word about his situation to his mother--my first and worst wife--and she and his sister  ----  already with him.\n",
      "of course it was impossible for me to go there, if there  ----  no other reasons, i was too immediately interested in this affair to be present, and i had no idea of undergoing a trial and a certain conviction for myself.\n",
      "but i sent down a new york lawyer with one hundred dollars, directing him to employ council there, and to adv ---- e and assist as much as he could.\n",
      "meanwhile, i remained in new york, anxious, it is true, yet almost certain that it would be impossible, under the circumstances, to convict henry of the kidnapping for which he  ----  indicted.\n",
      "he had not even assisted in the affair, and  ----  sure his counsel would be able to so convince the court and jury.\n",
      "and reviewing the whole matter, now in my cooler moments, th ----  scheme of trying to carry away sarah's son, seemed to be as foolish, useless, and mad, as any one of my marrying adventures.\n",
      "till i picked him out from  ---- ong his schoolmates, i had never seen the child at all.\n",
      "when i started from port jerv ----  to go down, as i supposed, into pennsylvania, i had no more idea of kidnapping the boy than i had of robbing a sheep-fold.\n",
      "it  ----  only when the landlord at water gap told me that sarah had remarried, and was wedded to a worthless, drunken husband, that i conceived the plan of removing the boy from such associations.\n",
      "i  ----  going to bring him up in a respectable manner.\n",
      "waiting for the verdict--my son sent to state pr ---- on--what sarah would have done--interview with my first wife--help for henry--the biddeford widow--her effort to marry me--our visit to boston--a warning--a generous gift--henry pardoned--close of the scheimer account--visit to ontario county--my rich cousins--what might have been--my birth--place revisited.\n",
      "it  ----  so plain a case, as it seemed to me, and must appear, i thought, to everybody, that i hardly doubted his instant acquittal.\n",
      "but very shortly the new york lawyer whom i had sent to belvidere, c ---- e back and brought terrible news.\n",
      "henry had been tried, and notwithstanding the fairest showing in his favor, he  ----  convicted and sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment at trenton.\n",
      "as it appe ---- d, it was i really, and not henry, who was on trial.\n",
      "the circumstances of the desperate struggle, and my knocking down one of the men with the butt of my whip,  ----  conspicuous in the case.\n",
      "even the little boy  ----  put on the stand, and was made to testify against his older half-brother.\n",
      "henry himself  ----  astounded at the result of the trial, and was firmly convinced that instead of \"proving his innocence\" to jersey jurymen, he had better have let his innocence go by default.\n",
      "we never even got back again the three hundred dollars which had been put into the hands of the man who went bail for henry when he  ----  bound over for trial.\n",
      "for us, it  ----  bad business from beginning to end.\n",
      "henry wrote a letter to me, that just before his trial, before he had delivered himself up, and while he  ----  still under bail, he had gone to see sarah scheimer on the little farm which was bought with her money, and was worked, so far as it was worked at all, by her drunken husband.\n",
      "the f ---- ily were even poorer than the landlord at water gap had reported.\n",
      "sarah herself  ----  miserable and unhappy.\n",
      "she told henry, when he informed her who he  ---- , that if i had wanted to see her or her son, i should have been welcome.\n",
      "she would have been very glad to have had me take the boy and clothe him decently; but she could not part with him, and would not have let me take him away; still, i could see him at any time, and as often as i liked, and the boy should grow up to know and to look upon me as h ----  father.\n",
      "and this, really, was all i desired, all i wanted; and it was all easily within my grasp, ready in fact to be put into my hands, and i had gone ahead in my usual mad, blundering way, acting, not only without advice, but against such advice as c ---- e from henry at the last moment, and had alienated the mother from me, lost the boy, and had sent henry, who was wholly innocent, to state prison for eighteen months.\n",
      "the poor fellow  ----  take to trenton and was put into the prison where i had spent seven months.\n",
      "he  ----  almost crazy when he got there.\n",
      "h ----  mother and sister went with him, and took lodgings in the place so as to be near him, to render him any assistance that might be in their power.\n",
      "i had  ----  idle now for some weeks in new york, and i went back to maine, to biddeford, where i lad a good practice.\n",
      "i picked up a good deal of money, and in two months i returned to new york to make a brief v ---- it, and to see if something could not be done for the release of henry from prison.\n",
      "she c ---- e, and we met for the first time in several years.\n",
      "we met now simply on business, and there  ----  no expression of sentiment or feeling on either side.\n",
      "we c ---- d nothing for each other.\n",
      "i commended her for her devotion to henry, and then told her i believed, if the proper efforts  ----  made, he could be pardoned out of prison.\n",
      "she  ----  grateful for the money, and was only too glad to go to work for henry; she would have done it long ago if she had only known what to do.\n",
      "th ----  business transacted, i at once returned to my practice at biddeford.\n",
      " ---- ong my patients was a wealthy widow, \"fat, fair, and forty,\" and i had not attended her long before a warm affection sprung up between us, and in time, when the widow recovered, we began to think we were in love with each other.\n",
      "i confess that i agreed to marry her; but it  ----  to be at some distant day--a very distant day as i intended--for, strange as it may seem, and as it did seem to me, i had at last learned the lesson that i had better let matrimony alone.\n",
      "i meant that my vermont impr ---- onment, the worst of all, should be the last.\n",
      "so i only \"courted\" the widow, calling upon her almost every day, and i  ----  received and presented to her acquaintances as her affianced husband.\n",
      "her f ---- ily and immediate friends were violently opposed to the match, thereby showing their good sense.\n",
      "i  ----  also informed that they knew something of my previous history, and i was warned that i had better not undertake to marry the widow.\n",
      "i was daily  ---- azed at my own common sense.\n",
      "my memory was active now; all my matrimonial mishaps of the past, with all the consequences,  ----  ever present to my mind, and never more present than when was in the company of the fascinating widow.\n",
      "as for her, the more her relatives opposed the match, the more she  ----  bent upon marrying me.\n",
      "her f ---- ily, she, said, were afraid they were going to lose her property, but she would never give them a cent of it, anyhow, and she would marry when and whom she pleased.\n",
      "not \"when,\" exactly; because, as she protested she would marry me, i had something to say about it; i had  ----  run away with by a milliner in vermont, and i had no idea of beings forcibly wedded by a widow in maine.\n",
      "i pleaded that my business  ----  not sufficiently established; i was liable to be called away from time to time; i had affairs to arrange in new york and elsewhere before i could settle down; and so the happy day was put off to an indefinite future time.\n",
      "by-and-by i had business in boston, and the widow decl ---- d that she would go with me; she wanted to visit her friend's there and do some shopping; and without making particular mention of her intention to her relatives, she went with me, and we were in boston together more than two weeks.\n",
      "at the end of that time she returned to biddeford and notified her friends treat she  ----  married to the doctor, though she had no certificate, not even a troy one, to show for it.\n",
      "i deemed it adv ---- able not to go back with her, but went to worcester for a while.\n",
      "in a few days i went to biddeford, keeping somewhat close, for i did not c ----  to meet any of the relatives, and at night i called upon the widow.\n",
      "she told me that her f ---- ily had raised a tremendous fuss about me, and had learned as much as they, and indeed she, wanted to know about my adventures in vermont and new hampshire.\n",
      "they had not gone back of that, but that  ----  enough.\n",
      "it  ----  dangerous, she told me, for me to stay there; i was sure to be arrested; i had better get away from the place as soon as possible.\n",
      "we might meet again by-and-by, but unless i wanted to  ----  arrested i must leave, the place that very night.\n",
      "besides what the widow bad given me, i had made more than one thousand dollars in maine, and  ----  comparatively well off.\n",
      "then c ---- e the joyful intelligence that henry was released.\n",
      "h ----  mother had worked for him night and day.\n",
      "she bad drawn up a petition, secured a large num ---- r of sterling signatures, had gone with her counsel to see the governor, had presented the petition and all the facts in the case, and the governor had granted a pardon.\n",
      "henry served only six months of the eighteen for which he was sentenced, and very soon after i received word that he was free, he c ---- e to me in boston, stayed a few days, and then went home to his mother in unadilla.\n",
      "from boston i went to pittsford, ontario county, n. y., where i had many friends, who knew nothing about any of my marriages or m ---- fortunes, my arrests or imprisonments.\n",
      "i went visiting merely, and enjoyed myself so much that i stayed there nearly three months, going about the country, and practicing a little  ---- ong my friends.\n",

      " ---- ong the friends whom i visited in ontario county, and with whom i passed several pleasant weeks, were two cousins of mine whom i had not seen for many years, since we were children in fact, but who gave me a most cordial welcome, and made much of me while i was there.\n",
      "they knew absolutely nothing of my unhappy h ---- tory--no unpleasant rumor even respecting me, had ever penetrated that quiet quarter of the state.\n",
      "i told them what i pleased of my past c ---- er, from boyhood to the present time, and to them i was only a tolerably successful doctor, who made money enough to live decently and dress well, and who was then suffering from overwork and badly in need of recuperation.\n",
      "this, indeed,  ----  the ostensible reason for my visit to ontario.\n",
      "i  ----  somewhat shattered; my old prison trials and troubles began to tell upon me.\n",
      "i used to think sometimes that i was a little \"out of my head;\" i certainly was so whenever i entered upon one of my matrimonial schemes, and i must have been as mad as a march h ----  when i attempted to kidnap sarah scheimer's boy.\n",
      "my cousins  ----  more than well-to-do farmers; they were enormously rich in lands and money.\n",
      "just after the war of 1812, their father, my uncle, and my own father, had come to th ---- , then wild and almost uninhabited, section of the state to settle.\n",
      "soon after they arrived there my father's wife died, and this loss, with the general loneliness of the region, to say nothing of the fever and ague, soon drove my father back to delaw ----  county to his forge for a living, and to the day of his death he was nothing more than a hard-working, hand-to-mouth-living, common blacksmith.\n",
      "but my uncle stayed there, and, as time went on, he bought hundreds of acres of land for a mere song, which  ----  now immensely valuable, and had made his children almost the richest people in that region.\n",
      "my cousins  ----  great farmers, extensive raisers of stock, wool-growers, and everything else that could make them prosperous.\n",
      "there seemed to  ----  no end to their wealth, and their fiat farms, spread out on every side as far as the eye could see.\n",
      "and if my father had only stayed there, i could not help but think what a different life mine might have  ---- .\n",
      "instead of being the adventurer i  ---- , and had been ever since i separated from my first and worst wife--doing well, perhaps, for a few weeks or a few months, and then blundering into a mad marriage or other difficulty which got me into prison; well-to-do to-day and to-morrow a beggar--i, too, might have been rich and respectable, and should have, saved myself a world of suffering.\n",
      "this  ----  but a passing thought which did not mar my visit, or make it less pleasant to me.\n",
      "i went there to be happy, not to be miserable, and for three months i  ----  happy indeed.\n",
      "from there i went to my birthplace in columbia county, rev ---- iting old scenes and the very few old friends and acquaintances who survived, or who had not moved away.\n",
      "i spent a month there and thereabouts, and at the end of that time i felt full restored to my usual good health, and  ----  ready to go to work again, not in the matrimonial way, but in my medical business, that was enough for me now.\n",
      "settling down in maine--henry's health--tour through the south--secession times--december in new orleans--up the mississippi--leaving henry in massachusetts--back in maine again--return to boston--profitable horse trading--plenty of money--my first wife's children--how they had been brought up--a b ---- faced robbery--attempt to blackmail me--my son tries to rob and kill me--my rescue--last of the young man.\n",
      "where to go, not what to do,  ----  the next question.\n",
      "wherever i might go and establish myself, if only for a few days, or a few weeks, i  ----  sure to have almost immediately plenty of patients and customers enough for my medicines--this had been my experience always--and unfortunately for me, i was almost equally sure to get into some difficulty from which escape was not always easy.\n",
      "looking over the whole ground for a fresh start in business, it seemed to me that maine  ----  the most favorable place.\n",
      "whenever i had been there i had done well; it  ----  one of the very few states i had lived in where i had not been in jail or in prison; nor had i been married there, though the biddeford widow did her best to wed me, and it is not her fault that she did not succeed in doing it.\n",
      "while i  ----  there i heard the most unfavorable reports with regard to the health of my eldest son henry.\n",
      "pr ---- on life at trenton had broken him down in body as well as in spirit, and he had been ill, some of the time seriously, nearly all the time since he went to unadilla.\n",
      "the fact that he  ----  entirely innocent of the offence for which he was imprisoned, preyed upon his mind, and with the worst results.\n",
      "as these stories reached me from week to week, i bec ---- e anxious and even alarmed about him, and at last i left my lucrative business in augusta and went to new york.\n",
      "i could not well go to unadilla to visit henry without seeing his mother, whom i had no desire to see; so i sent for him to come to me in the city if  ----  able to do so.\n",
      "i knew that if medicine or medical attendance would  ---- nefit him, i should be able to help him.\n",
      "in a few days he c ---- e to me in a most deplorable physical condition.\n",
      "he  ----  a mere wreck of his former self.\n",
      "almost immediately he began to talk about the attempt to abduct the boy from oxford; how innocent he  ----  in the matter, and how terribly he had suffered merely because he happened to be with me when i rashly endeavored to kidnap the lad.\n",
      "all th ----  went through me like a sharp sword.\n",
      "it seemed as if i was the cause, not only of great unhappiness to myself, but of pain and misery to all who  ----  associated or brought in contact with me.\n",
      "for th ----  poor boy, who had endured and suffered so much on my account, i could not do enough.\n",
      "my means and time must now be devoted to his recovery, if recovery,  ----  possible.\n",
      "he  ----  weak, but was still able to walk about, and he enjoyed riding very much.\n",
      "i kept him with me in the city a week or two, taking daily rides to the park and into the country, and when he felt like going out in the evening i made him go to some place of  ---- usement with me.\n",
      "i had no other business, and meant to have none, but to take c ----  of henry, and i devoted myself wholly to his comfort and happiness.\n",
      "fortunately, my recent maine business had put me in possession of abundant funds, and when i had matured my scheme, and saw that henry  ----  in tolerable condition to travel, i proposed the trip to him, and he joyfully assented to my plan.\n",
      "i wanted to get him far away, for awhile, from a part of the country which  ----  associated in his mind, more than in mine, with so much misery, and he seemed quite as eager to go.\n",
      "it  ----  late in the fall of 1860, just before the rebellion, when the south was seceding or talking secession, and was already preparing for war.\n",
      "everywhere there was a great deal of excitement; meetings  ----  held nearly every night secession was at fever heat, and there was an unbounded expression and manifestation of ill-feeling against the north and against northern men.\n",
      "nevertheless, i  ----  never in any part of the union where i was treated with so much courtesy, consideration and genuine kindness as i was there and then.\n",
      "i  ----  going south, simply to benefit the invalid who accompanied me; everybody seemed to know it; and everybody expressed the tenderest sympathy for my son.\n",
      "at atlanta, augusta, mobile, and other places, where we made our stay long enough to get a little acquainted, my son and myself  ----  daily taken out to ride, and were shown everything of interest that was to be seen.\n",
      "henry did not enjoy this journey more than i did--to me as well as to him, the trip  ----  one prolonged pleasure, and by the time we reached new orleans nearly a month after we left new york, my son had so recuperated that i had every hope of his speedy and full restoration.\n",
      "it  ----  the beginnings of winter when we reached new orleans; but during the whole month of december while we remained in that city, winter, if indeed it was winter, which we could hardly believe, was only a prolongation of the last beautiful autumn days we had left at the north.\n",
      "now orleans was then at the very height of prosperity; business was brisk, money was plenty, the ships of all nations and countless ste ---- boats from st. louis, cincinnati, louisville and all points up the mississippi and ohio rivers lay at the levee.\n",
      "the levee itself, from end to end, for miles along the river front,  ----  one mass of merchandise which had come to the city, or was awaiting shipment.\n",
      "indescribably gay, too,  ----  new orleans that winter.\n",
      "the city was full of strangers; the hotels  ----  thronged; there were balls every night; the theatres were crowded, and everybody seemed bent on having a good time.\n",
      "with all the rest, there was an extraordinary military furor, and militia companies and regiments paraded the streets every day, while secession meetings were held in various halls, or in the public squ ---- s, nearly ever night.\n",
      "sunday brought no rest, for sunday, so far as military parades,  ---- usement and general gaiety were concerned, was the liveliest day in the week; and sunday night the theatres were sure to present their best performances and to draw their largest audiences.\n",
      "and so, from morning till night, and from night till morning again, all  ----  whirl, stir, bustle, business, enjoyment, and excitement.\n",
      "to me, unaccustomed as i was to such scenes, new york even seemed t ---- e and dull, and slow in comparison with new orleans.\n",
      "th ----  is a picture of the crescent city as it presented itself to me and to my son in the early part of the winter before the war.\n",
      "no one knew or even dre ---- ed of the terrible times that were to come.\n",
      "no one believed that war was probable, or even possible; it was well enough, perhaps, to prep ----  for it; but secession was to be an accomplished fact, and the north and all the world would quietly acknowledge it.\n",
      "this  ----  the general sentiment in the city; though secession, and what would, or what might come of it, was the general topic of talk in the hotels, in the restaurants, at the theatres, in the streets, everywhere.\n",
      "now and then some southerner with whom i had  ---- come acquainted would try to draw me out to ascertain my sentiments on the subject, but i always laughed, and said good naturedly: \"my dear sir, i didn't come down here to talk about secession, but to see if the southern climate would benefit my sick son.\"\n",
      "the fact  ----  that i minded my own business, and minded it so well that while i was in new orleans i managed to find a few patients and sold recipes and medicines enough to pay the entire expenses of our journey thus far, from the north.\n",
      "it  ----  a month of genuine enjoyment to us both; of profit to me pecuniarily; and of the best possible benefit to henry's health.\n",
      "early in january we took passage on one of the finest of the mississippi ste ---- boats for st. louis.\n",
      "the boat was crowded, and  ---- ong the passengers were a good many merchants, northern men long resident in new orleans, who thought they saw trouble coming, and accordingly had closed up their business in the crescent city, and were now going north to stay there.\n",
      "we had on board, too, the usual complement of g ---- blers and amateur or professional poker-players, who kept the forward saloon near the bar, and known in the river vernacular as the \"texas\" of the boat, lively all day long and well into the night, or rather the next morning.\n",
      "it  ----  ten or eleven days before we reached st. louis.\n",
      "nothing notable occurred on the trip; but day after day, as we proceeded northward, and left the soft, sunny south  ---- hind us, with the daily increasing coldness and wintry weather, henry seemed to decline by degrees, and gradually to lose nearly all that he had gained since we left new york.\n",
      "when we reached st. louis he  ----  seriously sick.\n",
      "i  ----  very sorry we had come away so soon in the season, and proposed that we should return and stay in the south till spring; but henry would not consent.\n",
      "there  ----  nothing to be done, then, but to hurry on to the east, and when we arrived in new york henry would not go home to his mother in unadilla, but insisted upon accompanying me to boston.\n",
      "i was willing enough that he should go with me, for then i could have him under my exclusive c ---- ; but when we arrived in boston he was so overcome by the excitement of travel, and was so feeble from fatigue as well as disease, that instead of having him go with me to augusta, as i intended, by the advice of a friend i took him into the country where he could be nursed, be quiet, and be well taken care of till spring.\n",
      "i left him in good hands, prom ---- ing to come and see him as soon as i could, and then went back to my old business in augusta.\n",
      "it required a little time to knot the new end of that business to the end where i had broken off three months before; but i  ----  soon in full practice again and was once more making and saving money.\n",
      "in augusta and in several other towns which i visited, for the whole of the rest of the winter, i  ----  as busy as i could be.\n",
      "early in the spring i made up my mind to run away for a week or two, and arranged my business so that i could go down into massachusetts and visit henry, hoping, if he  ----  better, to bring him back with me to maine.\n",
      "two of my patients in paris, maine, had each given me a good horse in payment for my attendance upon them and their f ---- ilies, and for what medicines i had furnished, and i took these horses with me to sell in boston.\n",
      "i drove them down, putting a good supply of medicines in my wagon to sell in towns on the way, and when i arrived in boston sold out the establ ---- hment, getting one hundred and twenty-five dollars for the wagon, three hundred dollars for one horse, and four hundred dollars for the other--a pretty good profit on my time and medicine for the two patients--and i brought with me besides about eighteen hundred dollars, the net result, above my living expenses, of about three months' business in maine, and what i had done on the way down through massachusetts.\n",
      "i  ----  thus minute about this money because it now devolves upon me to show what sort of a family of children my first and worst wife had brought up.\n",
      "of these children by my first marriage, my eldest son henry, since he had grown up, had been with me nearly as much as he had been with h ----  mother, and i loved him as i did my life.\n",
      "since he bec ---- e of age, at such times when i was not in prison, or otherwise unavoidably separated from him, we had been associated in business, and had traveled and lived together.\n",
      "shortly after i sold my horses, one day i  ----  in my room at the hotel, when word was brought to me that some one in the parlor wanted to see me.\n",
      "i went down and found a young man, about twenty-one years of age, who immediately c ---- e to me addressing me as \"father,\" and he then presented a young woman, about two years older than he was, as his sister and my daughter.\n",
      "i had not seen this young gentleman since the time when i had carried him off from school and from the farmer to whom he was bound, and had clothed him and taken him with me to  ---- sterdam and troy, subsequently sending him to my half-sister at sidney.\n",
      "the ragged little lad, as i found him, had grown up into a stout, good-looking young man; but i had no difficulty in recognizing him, though i was much at loss to know the precise object of this visit; so after shaking hands with them, and asking then how they  ---- , i next inquired what they wanted?\n",
      "well, they had been to see henry, and he  ----  a great deal better.\n",
      "i told them i  ----  very glad to hear it, and that i was then on my way to visit him, and hoped to see him in a few days, as soon as i could finish my business in boston; if henry was as well as they reported i should bring him away with me.\n",
      "\"but if you  ----  busy here,\" said my young man, \"we can save you both time and trouble.\n",
      "we will go to henry again and settle h ----  bills for board and other expenses, and will bring him with us to you at this hotel.\"\n",
      "chan laiwa, 69,  ----  president of the hong kong-based fu wah international group, a multinational company established in 1988 involved in real estate development, hotel business, tourism and electronics.\n",
      "th ---- , at the time, really seemed to me a kindly offer; it would enable me to stay in boston and attend to business i had to do, and henry would come there with his brother and sister in a day or two.\n",
      "i at once assented to the plan, and taking my well-filled pocket-book from the inside breast pocket of my coat, i counted out two hundred and fifty dollars and gave them to the young man to pay henry's board, doctor's and other bills, and the necessary car f ---- s for the party.\n",
      "at last word c ---- e to me one day that some one down stairs wanted to see me and i told the servant to send him to my room, hoping that it might be henry.\n",
      "but no; it was my young man, of whom i instantly demanded: \"where is your brother, whom you  ----  to bring to me a week ago?\n",
      "what have you done with the money i gave you for h ----  bills?\"\n",
      "\"i hadn't been near henry; s ---- ter has gone home; and i've spent the money on a spree, every cent of it, here in boston, and i want more.\"\n",
      "i exclaimed in blank  ---- azement: \"yes, more; and if you don't give it to me, i'll follow you wherever you go, and tell people all i know about you.\"\n",
      "get out of my sight th ----  instant.\"\n",
      "he  ----  younger and stronger than i was, and as i felt that i was growing weaker i called out loudly for help and shouted \"murder!\"\n",
      "the landlord himself c ---- e running into the room; i succeeded in tearing myself away, from the grasp of my assailant, and the landlord felled him to the floor with a chair.\n",
      "i exclaimed; \"don't arrest the villain, for i can make no complaint against him--he  ----  my son!\"\n",
      "but the landlord  ----  bound to have some satisfaction out of the affair; so he dragged the young man into the hall and kicked him from the top of the stairs to the bottom, where, as soon as he had picked himself up, a convenient servant kicked him out into the street.\n",
      "i have never set eyes on my young man since h ----  somewhat sudden departure from that hotel.\n",
      "and when i went to visit my poor henry a day or two afterwards, i can hardly say that i  ----  surprised, though i was indignant to learn that his brother and sister had never been near him at all since he had been in massachusetts.\n",
      "they knew where and how he was from his letter's to his mother; they knew, too, from the s ---- e letters--for i had notified henry--at what time i would be in boston, and with this information they had come on to swindle me.\n",
      "i have no doubt, when the young man c ---- e the second time to rob me, he would have murdered me, if the landlord had not come to my assistance.\n",
      "and this  ----  the youngest son of my first and worst wife!!\n",
      "i found henry in  ---- tter condition than i expected, and i took him back with me to augusta.\n",

      "during all th ----  time, i behaved myself, in all respects better than i had ever before done in any period of my life.\n",
      "i began to look upon myself as a reformed man; i had learned to let liquor alone, and  ----  consequently in far less, indeed, next to no danger of stepping into the traps in which my feet had been so often caught.\n",
      "i may as well confess it--it  ----  intoxicating liquor, and that mainly, which had led me into my various mad marrying schemes and made me the matrimonial monomaniac and lunatic lover that i was for years.\n",
      "i had grown older, w ---- er, and certainly better.\n",
      "what had become of all my wives in the meantime, i scarcely knew and hardly c ---- d.\n",

      "it was this little circumstance, i think--my chance meeting with my old fellow-prisoner, and my changed circumstances and appearance which put me beyond recognition by him--that prompted me to the somewhat brazen business that followed: \"i only c ---- e in to look to-day,\" i said to the carpet-dealer; \"for the precise sum of money in my pocket at present is eighteen pence, and no more; but if you will cut me off forty yards of that piece of carpeting, and trust me for it, i will pay your bill in a few days, as sure as i live.\"\n",
      "my frank statement with regard to my finances seemed to attract the attention of the merchant who laughed and said: \"well, who  ----  you, anyhow?\n",
      "i told him that i  ----  doctor blank; that i lived in rensselaer county on a small place of my own; i raised fruit and vegetables for market; i cured cancers, dropsy, and other diseases when i could; sold medicines readily almost where i would; and was in albany once or twice a week.\n",
      "\"measure and cut off the carpet,\" said he to the clerk who  ----  following us, \"and put it in the doctor's wagon\" the bill was about a hundred dollars, and i drove home with the carpet.\n",
      "it  ----  nearly six weeks afterwards when i went into the store again, and greeted the proprietor.\n",
      "he had seen me but once  ---- fore and had totally forgotten me.\n",
      "i told him i  ----  doctor blank, small farmer and large medical practitioner of rensselaer county.\n",
      "\"the devil you  ---- !\n",
      "why, you're the man that bought a carpet of me a few weeks ago; i  ----  wondering what had become of you.\"\n",
      "\"well, you  ----  an odd chap, any how,\" said the carpet-dealer, laughing, and shaking me by the hand.\n",
      "almost from that moment we  ----  more than mere acquaintances, we were fast friends.\n",
      "in the course of the long conversation that followed, i told him of my trouble with the hardware man--how i had sold him the recipe; that he had failed, from ignorance to conduct the business properly, and had sued me for d ---- ages.\n",
      "\"i know the man,\" said my new friend; \"let him go ahead and sue and  ----  benefited, if he can; meanwhile, do you keep easy; i'll stand by you.\"\n",
      "the hardware man sued me no less than nineteen times, and for pretty much everything--d ---- ages, debt, breach of contract, and what not.\n",
      "with the assistance of a lawyer whom my friend recommended to me, i beat my opponent in eighteen successive suits; but as fast as one suit  ----  decided he brought another, almost before i could get out of the court room.\n",
      "the matter from  ---- ginning to end, must have cost him a mint of money; but he went on regardless of the costs which he hoped and expected to get out of me at last.\n",
      "my long and painful experience, covering many years, had given me a pretty thorough knowledge of the law's uncertainty, as well as the law's delay, and very early in the course of the present suit, i had quietly d ---- posed of my property in rensselaer county.\n",
      "i sold the little farm, which cost me sixteen hundred dollars, for twenty-one hundred dollars, and i had had,  ---- sides, the profits of nearly two years' farming and a good living from and on the place.\n",
      "i also arranged all my money matters in a manner that i felt assured would be satisfactory to me, if not to my opponent, and then, following the advice of my friend, the carpet-dealer, i let the hardw ----  man sue and be \"benefited if he could.\"\n",
      "when, however, the case went finally to a referee who  ----  certain, i felt sure, to decide against me, i took no further personal interest in the matter, nor have i ever troubled myself to learn the filial decision.\n",
      "i made up my mind in a moment and decided that the time had come, at last, when it  ----  advisable for me to go to the west.\n",
      "westward i went, towards sunset almost, and for the two following years i led, i fear, what would  ----  considered a very vagabond life.\n",
      "i went to utah, thinking while i  ----  in salt lake city, if they only knew my history there i was sure to be elected an apostle, or should be, at any rate, a shining light in mormondom--only i had taken my wives in regular succession, and had not assembled the throng together.\n",
      "i pushed across the plains, and went to california, remaining a long time in san franc ---- co.\n",
      "this may have been vagabondism, but it  ----  profitable vagabondism to me.\n",
      "during this long wandering i held no communication with my friends in the east; friends and foes alike had an opportunity to forget me, or if they thought of me they did not know whether i  ----  dead or alive; they certainly never knew, all the time, where i was; and while i was journeying i never once met a man or woman who had been acquainted with me in the past.\n",
      "all the time, too, i had plenty of money; indeed, when, i returned at last i  ----  richer far than i was when i left albany, and left as the common saying graphically expresses it, \"between two days.\"\n",
      "i had my old resources of recipes, medicines and my profession, and these i used, and had plenty of opportunity to use, to the  ---- st advantage.\n",
      "i could have settled in san franc ---- co for life with the certainty of securing a handsome annual income.\n",
      "i never fe ---- d coming to want.\n",
      "if i had lost my money and all other resources had failed, i  ----  not afraid to make a horse-nail or turn a horse-shoe with the best blacksmith in california, and i could have got my living, as i did for many a year, at the forge and anvil.\n",
      "in every conceivable way my two years' wandering was of far more benefit to me than i dre ---- ed of when i wildly set out for the west without knowing exactly where, or for what, i was going.\n",
      "the new country, too, had given me, not only a fresh fund of ideas, but a new stock of health--morally and physically i  ----  in better condition than i ever was before in my life.\n",
      "i had a clear head; a keen sense of my past follies; a vivid consciousness of the consequences which such follies, crimes they may be called,  ----  almost certain to bring.\n",
      "i flattered myself that i  ----  not only a reformed prisoner, but a reformed drunkard, and a thoroughly restored matrimonial monomaniac.\n",
      "and when i returned, at last, to the east, and went once more to visit my near and dear friends in ontario county, i  ----  received as one who had come back from the dead.\n",
      "when i had been here a few weeks, and had communicated to my cousins so much of the story of my life as i then thought adv ---- able, i took good counsel and finally did what i ought to have done long years before.\n",
      "i do not need to dwell upon the particulars; it is enough to say, that the woman, who  ----  then living, so far from opposing me, aided me all she could, even making affidavit to her adultery with the hotel clerk at bainbridge, long ago, and i easily secured my full and complete divorce.\n",
      "now i was, indeed, a free man--all the other wives whom i had married, or who had married me, whether i would or no,  ----  as nothing; some were dead and others were again married.\n",
      "it may be that th ----  new, and to me strange sense of freedom, legitimate freedom, set me to thinking that i might now secure a genuine and true wife, who would make a new home happy to me as long as we both should live.\n",
      "it  ----  not many months before i met a woman who seemed to me in every way calculated to fill the first place in that home which i had pictured as a final rest after all my woes and wanderings.\n",
      "she  ----  all that my heart could desire.\n",
      "i was tolerably well off; my position was reputable; my connections  ----  respectable.\n",
      "it  ----  no hasty courtship; we knew each other for months and learned to know each other well; and with true love for each other, we had for each other a genuine respect.\n",
      "she only pitied my misfortunes, pardoned my errors, and, one bright, golden, happy autumn day, we  ----  married.\n",

      "the surrounding country is charming--g ---- e in the woods, and fish in the streams afford abundant sport, and the region is far away from large cities, and remote even from railroads.\n",

      "for in war the obvious danger of a bullet is but a three hundred to one shot, while in the pack against the combatant the jokers  ----  innumerable.\n",
      "and in the c ---- er of the general the unforeseen adventures are the most interesting.\n",
      "a man who in eighteen c ---- paigns has played his part would seem to have earned exemption from any other risks, but often it was outside the battle-field that maciver encountered the greatest danger.\n",
      "he fought several duels, in two of which he killed his adversary; several attempts  ----  made to assassinate him, and while on his way to mexico he was captured by hostile indians.\n",
      "on returning from an expedition in cuba he  ----  cast adrift in an open boat and for days was without food.\n",
      "long before i met general maciver i had read h ----  book and had heard of him from many men who had met him in many different lands while engaged in as many different undertakings.\n",
      "several of the older war correspondents knew him intimately; bennett burleigh of the _telegraph_  ----  his friend, and e. f. knight of the _times_ was one of those who volunteered for a filibustering expedition which maciver organized against new guinea.\n",
      "the late colonel ochiltree of texas told me tales of maciver's bravery, when as young men they  ----  fellow officers in the southern army, and stephen bonsal had met him when maciver was united states consul at denia in spain.\n",
      "when maciver arrived at th ----  post, the ex-consul refused to vacate the consulate, and maciver wished to settle the difficulty with duelling pistols.\n",
      "as denia is a small place, the inhabitants fe ---- d for their safety, and bonsal, who was our _charge d'affaires_ then, was sent from madrid to adjust matters.\n",
      "without bloodshed he got rid of the ex-consul, and later maciver so ende ---- d himself to the denians that they begged the state department to retain him in that place for the remainder of his life.\n",
      "before general maciver  ----  appointed to a high position at the st. louis fair, i saw much of him in new york.\n",
      "his room was in a side street in an old-fashioned boarding-house, and overlooked his neighbor's back yard and a typical new york city sumac tree; but when the general talked one forgot he was within a block of the elevated, and ro ---- ed over all the world.\n",

      "to sketch in a few thousand words a c ---- er that had developed under eighteen flags is in its very wealth embarrassing.\n",
      "here  ----  one story, as told by the scrap-book, of an expedition that failed.\n",
      "that it failed was due to a british cabinet minister; for had lord derby possessed the imagination of the soldier of fortune, his majesty's dominions might now be the richer by many thousands of squ ----  miles and many thousands of black subjects.\n",
      "on october 29, 1883, the following appe ---- d in the london _standard_: \"the new guinea exploration and colonization company is already chartered, and the first expedition expects to leave before christmas.\"\n",
      "th ----  subscription will include all expenses for passage money.\n",
      "six months' prov ---- ions will be provided, together with tents and arms for protection.\n",
      "each subscriber of one hundred pounds  ----  to obtain a certificate entitling him to one thousand acres.\"\n",
      "the view of the colonization scheme taken by the _times_ of london, of the s ---- e date, is less complaisant.\n",
      "\"the latest commercial sensation  ----  a proposed company for the seizure of new guinea.\n",
      "certain adventurous gentlemen  ----  looking out for one hundred others who have money and a taste for buccaneering.\n",
      "when the company has been completed, its sh ---- -holders are to place themselves under military regulations, sail in a body for new guinea, and without asking anybody's leave, seize upon the island and at once, in some unspecified way, proceed to realize large profits.\n",
      "if the idea does not suggest compar ---- ons with the large designs of sir francis drake, it is at least not unworthy of captain kidd.\"\n",
      "when we remember the manner in which some of the colonies of great britain were acquired, the _times_ seems almost sque ---- ish.\n",
      "in a melbourne paper, june, 1884,  ----  the following paragraph: \"toward the latter part of 1883 the government of queensland planted the flag of great britain on the shores of new guinea.\n",
      "the earl of derby, secretary for the colonies, refused, however, to sanction the annexation of new guinea, and in so doing acted contrary to the sincere w ---- h of every right-thinking anglo-saxon under the southern cross.\n",
      "\"while the subsequent correspondence between the home and queensland governments  ----  going on, brigadier-general h. r. maciver originated and organized the new guinea exploration and colonization company in london, with a view to establishing settlements on the island.\n",
      "the company, presided over by general beresford of the brit ---- h army, and having an eminently representative and influential board of directors, had a capital of two hundred and fifty thousand pounds, and placed the supreme command of the expedition in the hands of general maciver.\n",
      "notwithstanding the character of the gentlemen composing the board of directors, and the truly peaceful nature of the expedition, h ----  lordship informed general maciver that in the event of the latter's attempting to land on new guinea, instructions would be sent to the officer in command of her majesty's fleet in the western pacific to fire upon the company's vessel.\n",
      "th ----  meant that the expedition would be dealt with as a filibustering one.\"\n",
      "in _judy_, septem ---- r 21, 1887, appears: \"we all recollect the treatment received by brigadier-general maci.\n",
      "the general, who is a sort of pizarro, with a dash of d'artagnan,  ----  treated in a most scurvy manner by lord derby.\n",
      "had maciver not been thwarted in his enterprise, the whole of new guinea would now have been under the british flag, and we should not be cheek-by-jowl with the germans, as we  ----  in too many places.\"\n",
      "_society_, september 3, 1887, says: \"the new guinea expedition proved abortive, owing to the blundering shortsightedness of the then government, for which lord derby  ----  chiefly responsible, but what little foothold we possess in new guinea, is certainly due to general maciver's gallant effort.\"\n",
      "copy of statement made by j. rintoul mitchell, june 2, 1887: \"about the latter end of the year 1883, when i was editor-in-chief of the _englishman_ in calcutta, i was told by captain de deaux, assistant secretary in the foreign office of the indian government, that he had received a telegr ----  from lord derby to the effect that if general maciver ventured to land upon the coast of new guinea it would become the duty of lord ripon, viceroy, to use the naval forces at his command for the purpose of deporting general maci.\n",
      "sir aucland calvin can certify to this, as it  ----  discussed in the viceregal council.\"\n",
      "just after our civil war maciver  ----  interested in another expedition which also failed.\n",
      "its members called themselves the knights of arabia, and their object was to colonize an island much ne ---- r to our shores than new guinea.\n",
      "maciver, saying that his oath prevented, would never tell me which island this was, but the reader can choose from  ---- ong cuba, haiti, and the hawaiian group.\n",
      "to have taken cuba, the \"colonizers\" would have had to fight not only spain, but the cubans themselves, on whose side they  ----  soon fighting in the ten years' war; so cuba may be eliminated.\n",
      "and as the expedition  ----  to sail from the atlantic side, and not from san francisco, the island would appear to be the black republic.\n",
      "from the records of the times it would seem that the greater number of the knights of arabia  ----  veterans of the confederate army, and there is no question but that they intended to subjugate the blacks of haiti and form a republic for white men in which slavery would be recognized.\n",
      "as one of the leaders of this filibustering expedition, maciver  ----  arrested by general phil sheridan and for a short time cast into jail.\n",
      "th ----  chafed the general's spirit, but he argued philosophically that imprisonment for filibustering, while irksome, brought with it no reproach.\n",
      "and, indeed, sometimes the only difference between a filibuster and a government lies in the fact that the government fights the gun-boats of only the enemy while a filibuster must dodge the boats of the enemy and those of h ----  own countrymen.\n",
      "when the united states went to war with spain there  ----  many men in jail as filibusters, for doing that which at the time the country secretly approved, and later imitated.\n",
      "and because they attempted exactly the s ---- e thing for which dr. jameson was imprisoned in holloway jail, two hundred thousand of his countrymen are now wearing medals.\n",
      "ii reads: \"we, as knights of arabia, pledge ourselves to aid, comfort, and protect all knights of arabia, especially those who  ----  wounded in obtaining our grand object.\n",
      "\"iii--great c ----  must be taken that no unbeliever or outsider shall gain any insight into the mysteries or secrets of the order.\n",
      "\"v--all knights of arabia will  ----  entitled to one hundred acres of land, location of said land to be drawn for by lottery.\n",
      "the products  ----  coffee, sugar, tobacco, and cotton.\"\n",
      "a local correspondent of the new york _herald_ writes of the arrest of maciver as follows: \"when maciver will be tried  ----  at present unknown, as his case has assumed a complicated aspect.\n",
      "he claims british protection as a subject of her british majesty, and the english consul has forwarded a statement of his case to sir frederick bruce at  ---- hington, accompanied by a copy of the by-laws.\n",
      "general sheridan also has forwarded a statement to the secretary of war, accompanied not only by the by-laws, but very important documents, including letters from jefferson davis, benj ---- in, the secretary of state of the confederate states, and other personages prominent in the rebellion, showing that maciver enjoyed the highest confidence of the confederacy.\"\n",
      "as to the last statement, an open letter i found in h ----  scrap-book is an excellent proof.\n",
      "it is as follows: \"to officers and members of all c ---- ps of united confederate veterans: it affords me the greatest pleasure to say that the bearer of this letter, general henry ronald maciver, was an officer of great gallantry in the confederate army, serving on the staff at various times of general stonewall jackson, j. e. b. stuart, and e. kirby smith, and that his official record is one of which any man may be proud.\n",

      "the duel  ----  with swords.\n",
      "the correspondent writes: \"the confederate officer wiped h ----  sword on his handkerchief.\n",
      "one of major maciver's seconds called to him: 'he  ----  dead; you must go.\n",
      "a negro boy brought up the horses, but before mounting maciver said to captain tomlin's seconds: 'my friends  ----  in haste for me to go.\n",

      "i hope you consider that th ----  matter has been settled honorably?'\n",
      "\"there  ----  no reply, the confederates rode away.\"\n",
      "from the south maciver crossed through texas to join the royal ---- t army under the emperor maximilian.\n",
      "it  ----  while making his way, with other confederate officers, from galveston to el paso, that maciver was captured by the indians.\n",
      "he was not ill-treated by them, but for three months was a prisoner, until one night, the indians having c ---- ped near the rio grande, he escaped into mexico.\n",
      "there he offered h ----  sword to the royalist commander, general mejia, who placed him on his staff, and showed him some few skirmishes.\n",

      "on his return to glasgow, maciver foregathered with an old friend, bennett burleigh, whom he had known when burleigh  ----  a lieutenant in the navy of the confederate states.\n",
      "although today known as a distinguished war correspondent, in those days burleigh  ----  something of a soldier of fortune himself, and was organizing an expedition to assist the cretan insurgents against the turks.\n",
      "between the two men it was arranged that maciver should precede the expedition to crete and prep ----  for its arrival.\n",
      "the cretans received him gladly, and from the provisional government he received a commission in which he  ----  given \"full power to make war on land and sea against the enemies of crete, and particularly against the sultan of turkey and the turkish forces, and to burn, destroy, or capture any vessel bearing the turkish flag.\"\n",
      "this permission to destroy the turkish navy single-handed strikes one as more than generous, for the cretans had no navy, and before one could begin the destruction of a turkish gun-boat it  ----  first necessary to catch it and tie it to a wharf.\n",
      "at the close of the cretan insurrection maciver crossed to athens and served against the brigands in k ---- issia on the borders of albania and thessaly as volunteer aide to colonel corroneus, who had been commander-in-chief of the cretans against the turks.\n",
      "maciver spent three months potting at brigands, and for his services in the mountains  ----  recommended for the highest greek decoration.\n",
      "from greece it was only a step to new york, and almost immediately maciver appears as one of the goicouria-christo expedition to cuba, of which goicouria was commander-in-chief, and two f ---- ous american officers, brigadier-general samuel c. williams was a general and colonel wright schumburg was chief of staff.\n",

      "there they  ----  set at liberty, but their arms, boat, and stores were confiscated.\n",
      "goicouria's force was finally scattered, and maciver escaped from the spanish soldiery only by putting to sea in an open boat, in which he endeavored to make j ---- aica.\n",
      "on the third day out he was picked up by a ste ---- er and again landed at nassau, from which place he returned to new york.\n",
      "at that time in this city there was a very interesting man n ---- ed thaddeus p. mott, who had been an officer in our army and later had entered the service of ismail pasha.\n",

      "although in d ---- posing of his sword maciver never allowed his personal predilections to weigh with him, he always treated himself to a hearty dislike of the turks, and we next find him fighting against them in herzegovina with the montenegrins.\n",
      "and when the servians declared war against the s ---- e people, maciver returned to london to organize a cavalry brigade to fight with the servian army.\n",
      "of th ----  brigade and of the rapid rise of maciver to highest rank and honors in servia, the scrap-book is most eloquent.\n",
      "the cavalry brigade  ----  to be called the knights of the red cross.\n",
      "in a letter to the editor of the _hour_, the general himself speaks of it in the following terms: \"it may be interesting to many of your readers to learn that a select corps of gentlemen is at present in course of organization under the above title with the mission of proceeding to the levant to take measures in case of emergency for the defense of the christian population, and more especially of british subjects who  ----  to a great extent unprovided with adequate means of protection from the religious furies of the mussulmans.\n",
      "the lives of christian women and children  ----  in hourly peril from fanatical hordes.\n",
      "the knights will be c ---- fully chosen and kept within strict military control, and will be under command of a practical soldier with large experience of the eastern countries.\n",
      "templars and all other crusaders  ----  invited to give aid and sympathy.\"\n",
      "app ---- ntly maciver was not successful in enlisting many knights, for a war correspondent at the capital of servia, waiting for the war to begin, writes as follows: \"a scotch soldier of fortune, henry maciver, a colonel by rank, has arrived at belgrade with a small contingent of military adventurers.\n",
      "five weeks ago i met him in fleet street, london, and had some talk about h ----  'expedition.'\n",
      "he had received a commission from the prince of servia to organize and command an independent cavalry brigade, and he then  ----  busily enrolling his volunteers into a body styled 'the knights of the red cross.'\n",
      "i  ----  afraid some of his bold crusaders have earned more distinction for their attacks on fleet street bars than they are likely to earn on servian battle-fields, but then i must not anticipate history.\"\n",
      "another paper tells that at the end of the first week of his service as a servian officer, maciver had enlisted ninety men, but that they  ----  scattered about the town, many without shelter and rations: \"he assembled his men on the rialto, and in spite of official expostulation, the men were marched up to the minister's four abreast--and they marched fairly well, making a good show.\n",
      "the war minister  ----  taken by storm, and at once granted everything.\n",
      "it has ra ---- ed the english colonel's popularity with his men to fever heat.\"\n",

      "in 1888, either because, his patron the count de ch ---- bord having died, there was no more money to pay the fines, or because the patience of the government was exhausted, _triboulet_ ceased to exist, and harden-hickey, claiming the paper had been suppressed and he himself exiled, crossed to london.\n",
      "from there he embarked upon a voyage around the world, which lasted two years, and in the course of which he discovered the island kingdom of which he  ----  to be the first and last king.\n",
      "previous to his departure, having been divorced from the countess de saint-pery, he placed his boy and girl in the c ----  of a fellow-journalist and very dear friend, the count de la boissiere, of whom later we shall hear more.\n",
      "harden-hickey started around the world on the _astoria_, a brit ---- h merchant vessel bound for india by way of cape horn, captain jackson commanding.\n",
      "when off the coast of brazil the ship touched at the uninhabited  ---- land of trinidad.\n",
      "historians of j ---- es the first say that it was through stress of weather that the _astoria_ was driven to seek refuge there, but as, for six months of the year, to make a landing on the island is almost impossible, and as at any time, under stress of weather, trinidad would be a place to avoid, it is more likely jackson put in to replenish his water-casks, or to obtain a supply of turtle meat.\n",
      "or it may have been that, having told harden-hickey of the derelict  ---- land, the latter persuaded the captain to allow him to land and explore it.\n",
      "of this, at least, we are certain, a boat was sent ashore, harden-hickey went ashore in it, and before he left the island, as a piece of no man's land, belonging to no country, he claimed it in his own n ---- e, and upon the beach raised a flag of his own design.\n",
      "the  ---- land of trinidad claimed by harden-hickey must not be confused with the larger trinidad belonging to great britain and lying off venezuela.\n",
      "the engl ---- h trinidad is a smiling, peaceful spot of great tropical beauty; it is one of the fairest places in the west indies.\n",
      "a governor in a pith helmet, a cricket club, a b ---- hop in gaiters, and a botanical garden go to make it a prosperous and contented colony.\n",
      "but the little derelict trinidad, in latitude 20 degrees 30 minutes south, and longitude 29 degrees 22 minutes west, seven hundred miles from the coast of brazil,  ----  but a spot upon the ocean.\n",
      "on most maps it  ----  not even a spot.\n",
      "except by birds, turtles, and hideous land-crabs, it is uninhabited; and against the advances of man its shores  ----  fortified with cruel ridges of coral, jagged limestone rocks, and a tremendous towering surf which, even in a dead calm, beats many feet high against the coast.\n",
      "in 1698 dr. halley v ---- ited the island, and says he found nothing living but doves and land-crabs.\n",
      "after halley's visit, in 1700 the island  ----  settled by a few portuguese from brazil.\n",
      "the ruins of their stone huts  ----  still in evidence.\n",
      "but  ---- aro delano, who called in 1803, makes no mention of the portuguese; and when, in 1822, commodore owen visited trinidad, he found nothing living there save cormorants, petrels, gannets, man-of-war birds, and \"turtles weighing from five hundred to seven hundred pounds.\"\n",
      "in 1889 e. f. knight, who in the japanese-russian war represented the london _morning post_, v ---- ited trinidad in his yacht in search of buried treasure.\n",
      "alexander dalrymple, in his book entitled \"collection of voages, chiefly in the southern atlantick ocean, 1775,\" tells how, in 1700, he \"took possession of the island in his majesty's n ---- e as knowing it to be granted by the king's letter patent, leaving a union jack flying.\"\n",
      "so it appears that before harden-hickey seized the  ---- land it already had been claimed by great britain, and later, on account of the portuguese settlement, by brazil.\n",
      "the answer harden-hickey made to these claims  ----  that the english never settled in trinidad, and that the portuguese abandoned it, and, therefore, their claims lapsed.\n",
      "in h ----  \"prospectus\" of his island, harden-hickey himself describes it thus: \"trinidad is about five miles long and three miles wide.\n",
      "in spite of its rugged and uninviting appearance, the inland plateaus  ----  rich with luxuriant vegetation.\n",
      "\"prominent  ---- ong this is a peculiar species of bean, which is not only edible, but extremely palatable.\n",
      "the surrounding seas swarm with fish, which as yet  ----  wholly unsuspicious of the hook.\n",
      "dolphins, rock-cod, pigf ---- h, and blackfish may be caught as quickly as they can be hauled out.\n",
      "trinidad  ----  the breeding-place of almost the entire feathery population of the south atlantic ocean.\n",
      "turtles v ---- it the island to deposit eggs, and at certain seasons the beach is literally alive with them.\n",
      "the only drawback to my projected kingdom  ----  the fact that it has no good harbor and can be approached only when the sea is calm.\"\n",
      "as a matter of fact sometimes months pass before it  ----  possible to effect a landing.\n",
      "another asset of the island held out by the prospectus  ----  its great store of buried treasure.\n",
      "before harden-hickey seized the  ---- land, this treasure had made it known.\n",
      "th ----  is the legend.\n",
      "in 1821 a great store of gold and silver plate plundered from peruvian churches had been concealed on the  ---- lands by pirates near sugar loaf hill, on the shore of what is known as the southwest bay.\n",
      "much of this plate c ---- e from the cathedral at lima, having been carried from there during the war of independence when the spanish residents fled the country.\n",
      "one of these pirates on h ----  death-bed, in gratitude to his former captain, told him the secret of the treasure.\n",
      "in 1892 this captain was still living, in newcastle, england, and although his story bears a f ---- ily resemblance to every other story of buried treasure, there were added to the tale of the pirate some corroborative details.\n",
      "these, in twelve years, induced five different expeditions to v ---- it the island.\n",
      "the two most important  ----  that of e. f. knight and one from the tyne in the bark _aurea_.\n",
      "in h ----  \"cruise of the _alerte_,\" knight gives a full description of the island, and of his attempt to find the treasure.\n",
      "in this, a landslide having covered the place where it  ----  buried, he was unsuccessful.\n",
      "but knight's book is the only source of accurate information concerning trinidad, and in writing his prospectus it is evident that harden-hickey  ----  forced to borrow from it freely.\n",
      "knight himself says that the most minute and accurate description of trinidad  ----  to be found in the \"frank mildmay\" of captain marryat.\n",
      "he found it so easy to identify each spot mentioned in the novel that he  ---- lieves the author of \"midshipman easy\" himself touched there.\n",
      "in india he bec ---- e interested in buddhism, and remained for over a year questioning the priests of that religion and studying its tenets and history.\n",
      "on h ----  return to paris, in 1890, he met miss annie harper flagler, daughter of john h. flagler.\n",
      "a year later, on st. patrick's day, 1891, at the fifth avenue presbyterian church, miss flagler bec ---- e the baroness harden-hickey.\n",
      "for the next two years harden-hickey lived in new york, but so quietly that, except that he lived quietly, it  ----  difficult to find out anything concerning him.\n",
      "the man who, a few years before, had delighted par ----  with his daily feuilletons, with his duels, with his forty-two lawsuits, who had been the master of revels in the latin quarter, in new york lived almost as a recluse, writing a book on buddhism.\n",
      "while he was in new york i was a reporter on the _evening sun_, but i cannot recall ever having read his n ---- e in the newspapers of that day, and i heard of him only twice; once as giving an exhibition of his water-colors at the american art galleries, and again as the author of a book i found in a store in twenty-second street, just east of broadway, then the home of the truth seeker publishing company.\n",
      "it was a grewsome compilation and had just appe ---- d in print.\n",
      "it  ----  called \"euthanasia, or the ethics of suicide.\"\n",
      "this book  ----  an apology or plea for self-destruction.\n",
      "to support his arguments and to show that suicide was a noble act, he quoted plato, cicero, shakespe ---- , and even misquoted the bible.\n",
      "he gave a list of poisons, and the  ---- ount of each necessary to kill a human being.\n",
      "the book showed how far harden-hickey had strayed from the teachings of the jesuit college at n ---- ur, and of the church that had made him \"noble.\"\n",
      "all of these two years had not  ----  spent only in new york.\n",
      "the money to pay for these investments c ---- e from his father-in-law.\n",
      "whenever he wanted money he asked his wife, or de la boissiere, who  ----  a friend also of flagler, to obtain it for him.\n",
      "h ----  attitude toward his father-in-law is difficult to explain.\n",
      "it is not app ---- nt that flagler ever did anything which could justly offend him; indeed, he always seems to have spoken of his son-in-law with tolerance, and often with awe, as one would speak of a clever, wayward child.\n",
      "but harden-hickey chose to regard flagler as h ----  enemy, as a sordid man of business who could not understand the feelings and aspirations of a genius and a gentleman.\n",
      "before harden-hickey married, the m ---- understanding between his wife's father and himself began.\n",
      "because he thought harden-hickey  ----  marrying his daughter for her money, flagler opposed the union.\n",
      "consequently, harden-hickey married m ---- s flagler without \"settlements,\" and for the first few years supported her without aid from her father.\n",
      "but his wife had been accustomed to a manner of living beyond the means of the soldier of fortune, and soon his income, and then even his capital,  ----  exhausted.\n",
      "this  ----  in the hands of her father as executor.\n",
      "when his own money  ----  gone, harden-hickey endeavored to have the money belonging to his wife placed to her credit, or to his.\n",
      "to this, it is said, flagler, on the ground that harden-hickey  ----  not a man of business, while he was, objected, and urged that he was, and that if it remained in his hands the money would be better invested and better expended.\n",
      "it was the refusal of flagler to intrust harden-hickey with the c ----  of his wife's money that caused the breach between them.\n",
      "with the people  ---- ong whom he was thrown, his ideas were entirely out of joint.\n",
      "people who looked upon him as working for h ----  own hand entirely misunderstood him.\n",
      "he  ----  absolutely honest, and as absolutely without a sense of humor.\n",
      "to him, to pay taxes, to pay grocers' bills, to depend for protection upon a policeman,  ----  intolerable.\n",

      "in consequence of the accomplishment of these various formalities, and as the law of nations prescribes that 'derelict' territories belong to whoever will take possession of them, and as the island of trinidad, which has been abandoned for years, certainly belongs to the aforesaid category, his serene highness prince j ---- es i was authorized to regard his rights on the said island as perfectly valid and indisputable.\n",

      "he used many gestures, some of which were strongly reminiscent of his father, of whom he, unlike most english lads, who shy at mentioning a distinguished p ---- nt, constantly spoke.\n",
      "he even copied h ----  father in his little tricks of manner.\n",
      "standing with hands shoved under the frock-coat and one resting on each hip as though squeezing in the waist line; when seated, resting the elbows on the arms of the chair and nervously locking and unclasping fingers,  ----  tricks common to both.\n",
      "he then had and still has a most embarrassing habit of asking many questions; embarrassing, sometimes, because the questions  ----  so frank, and sometimes because they lay bare the wide expanse of one's own ignorance.\n",
      "at that time, although in h ----  twenty-first year, this lad twice had been made a question in the house of commons.\n",
      "when you consider out of great britain's four hundred million subjects how many live, die, and  ----  buried without at any age having drawn down upon themselves the anger of the house of commons, to have done so twice, before one has passed his twenty-first year, seems to promise a lurid future.\n",
      "the first time churchill disturbed the august assemblage in which so soon he was to become a leader was when he \"ragged\" a brother subaltern n ---- ed bruce and cut up his saddle and accoutrements.\n",
      "the second time  ----  when he ran away to cuba to fight with the spaniards.\n",
      "after this c ---- paign, on the first night of his arrival in london, he made his maiden speech.\n",
      "this  ----  the empire music hall.\n",
      "at the time mrs. orm ---- ton chant had raised objections to the presence in the music hall of certain young women, and had threatened, unless they ceased to frequent its promenade, to have the license of the music hall revoked.\n",
      "as a compromise, the management ceased selling liquor, and on the night churchill visited the place the bar in the promenade  ----  barricaded with scantling and linen sheets.\n",
      "with the thirst of tropical cuba still upon him, churchill asked for a drink, which  ----  denied him, and the crusade, which in his absence had been progressing fiercely, was explained.\n",
      "any one else would have taken no for h ----  answer, and have sought elsewhere for his drink.\n",
      "what he did is interesting, because it  ----  so extremely characteristic.\n",
      "now he would not do it; then he  ----  twenty-one.\n",
      "he scr ---- bled to the velvet-covered top of the railing which divides the auditorium from the promenade, and made a speech.\n",
      "it  ----  a plea in behalf of his \"sisters, the ladies of the empire promenade.\"\n",
      "\"where,\" he asked of the ladies themselves and of their escorts crowded below him in the promenade, \"does the engl ---- hman in london always find a welcome?\n",
      "who  ----  always there to greet him with a smile, and join him in a drink?\n",
      "who  ----  ever faithful, ever true--the ladies of the empire promenade.\"\n",
      "the laughter and cheers that greeted th ---- , and the tears of the ladies themselves, naturally brought the performance on the stage to a stop, and the vast audience turned in the seats and boxes.\n",
      "churchill turned with delight to the larger audience, and repeated h ----  appeal.\n",
      "the comm ---- sionaires and police tried to reach him and a good-tempered but very determined mob of well-dressed gentlemen and cheering girls fought them back.\n",
      "in triumph churchill ended his speech by begging his he ---- rs to give \"fair play\" to the women, and to follow him in a charge upon the barricades.\n",
      "the charge was instantly made, the barricades  ----  torn down, and the terrified management ordered that drink be served to its victorious patrons.\n",
      "shortly after striking this blow for the liberty of others, churchill organized a dinner which illustrated the direction in which at that age his mind was working, and showed that his  ---- bition was already abnormal.\n",
      "the dinner was given to those of his friends and acquaintances who \" ----  under twenty-one years of age, and who in twenty years would control the destinies of the british empire.\"\n",
      "as one over the age limit, or because he did not consider me an empire-controlling force, on this great occasion, i  ----  permitted to be present.\n",
      "but except that the number of incipient empire-builders was very great, that they  ----  very happy, and that save the host himself none of them took his idea seriously, i would not call it an evening of historical interest.\n",
      "but the fact  ----  interesting that of all the boys present, as yet, the host seems to be the only one who to any conspicuous extent is disturbing the destinies of great britain.\n",
      "when he  ----  twenty-three churchill obtained leave of absence from his regiment, and as there was no other way open to him to see fighting, as a correspondent he joined the malakand field force in india.\n",
      "it may be truthfully said that by his presence in that frontier war he made it and himself f ---- ous.\n",
      "his book on that c ---- paign is his best piece of war reporting.\n",
      "to the civilian reader it has all the delight of one of kipling's indian stories, and to writers on military subjects it  ----  a model.\n",
      "but it is a model very few can follow, and which churchill himself  ----  unable to follow, for the reason that only once is it given a man to be twenty-three years of age.\n",
      "the picturesque hand-to-hand fighting, the night attacks, the charges up precipitous hills, the retreats made carrying the wounded under constant fire, which he witnessed and in which he bore his part, he never again can see with the s ---- e fresh and enthusiastic eyes.\n",
      "then it was absolutely new, and the charm of the book and the value of the book  ----  that with the intolerance of youth he attacks in the service evils that older men prefer to let lie, and that with the ingenuousness of youth he tells of things which to the veteran have become unimportant, or which through usage he is no longer even able to see.\n",
      "in h ----  three later war books, the wonder of it, the horror of it, the quick admiration for brave deeds and daring men, give place, in \"the river war,\" to the critical point of view of the military expert, and in his two books on the boer war to the rapid impressions of the journalist.\n",
      "for his services with the malakand field force he received the c ---- paign medal with clasp, and, \"in despatches,\" brigadier-general jeffreys praises \"the courage and resolution of lieutenant w. l. s. churchill, fourth hussars, with the force as correspondent of the _pioneer_.\"\n",
      "from the operations around malakand, he at once joined sir willi ----  lockhart as orderly officer, and with the tirah expedition went through that campaign.\n",
      "for th ----  his indian medal gained a second clasp.\n",
      "this  ----  in the early part of 1898. in spite of the time taken up as an officer and as a correspondent, he finished his book on the malakand expedition and then, as it was evident kitchener would soon attack khartum, he jumped across to egypt and again as a correspondent took part in the advance upon that city.\n",
      "thus, in one year, he had seen service in three c ---- paigns.\n",
      "on the day of the battle h ----  luck followed him.\n",
      "kitchener had attached him to the twenty-first lancers, and it will be remembered the event of the battle  ----  the charge made by that squadron.\n",
      "it was no canter, no easy \"pig-sticking\"; it was a fight to get in and a fight to get out, with frenzied followers of the khalifa hanging to the bridle reins, hacking at the horses' h ---- strings, and slashing and firing point-blank at the troopers.\n",
      "churchill  ----  in that charge.\n",
      "this book is the last word on the c ---- paigns up the nile.\n",
      "the book made a d ---- tinct sensation.\n",
      "it  ----  a work that one would expect from a lieutenant-general, when, after years of service in egypt, he laid down his sword to pen the story of his life's work.\n",
      "from a second lieutenant, who had been on the nile hardly long enough to gain the desert tan, it  ----  a revelation.\n",
      "as a contribution to military history it  ----  so valuable that for the author it made many admirers, but on account of his criticisms of his superior officers it gained him even more enemies.\n",
      "this is a specimen of the kind of thing that caused the retired army officer to sit up and choke with apoplexy: \"general kitchener, who never sp ---- s himself, cares little for others.\n",
      "he treated all men like machines, from the private soldiers, whose salutes he d ---- dained, to the superior officers, whom he rigidly controlled.\n",
      "the comrade who had served with him and under him for many years, in peace and peril,  ----  flung aside as soon as he ceased to be of use.\n",
      "the wounded egyptian and even the wounded brit ---- h soldier did not excite his interest.\"\n",
      "when in the service clubs they read that, the veterans asked each other their favorite question of what is the army coming to, and to their own satisfaction ans ---- d it by pointing out that when a lieutenant of twenty-four can reprimand the commanding general the army is going to the dogs.\n",
      "to the newspapers, hundreds of them, over their own signatures, on the service club stationery, wrote violent, furious letters, and the newspapers themselves, besides the ordinary reviews, gave to the book editorial pra ---- e and editorial condemnation.\n",
      "equally disgusted  ----  the younger officers of the service.\n",
      "they nickn ---- ed his book \"a subaltern's advice to generals,\" and called churchill himself a \"medal snatcher.\"\n",
      "a medal snatcher is an officer who, whenever there is a rumor of war, leaves his men to the care of any one, and through influence in high places and for the sake of the c ---- paign medal has himself attached to the expeditionary force.\n",
      "but churchill never  ----  a medal hunter.\n",
      "the routine of barrack life irked him, and in foreign parts he served h ----  country far better than by remaining at home and inspecting awkward squads and attending guard mount.\n",
      "indeed, the war office could cover with medals the man who wrote \"the story of the malakand field force\" and \"the river war\" and still be in h ----  debt.\n",
      "in october, 1898, a month after the battle of omdurman, churchill made h ----  debut as a political speaker at minor meetings in dover and rotherhithe.\n",
      "h ---- tory does not record that these first speeches set fire to the channel.\n",
      "during the winter he finished and published his \"river war,\" and in the august of the following summer, 1899, at a by-election, offered himself as member of parli ---- ent for oldham.\n",
      "in the _daily telegraph_ his letters from the three c ---- paigns in india and egypt had made his name known, and there was a general desire to hear him and to see him.\n",
      "in one who had attacked kitchener of khartum, the men of oldh ----  expected to find a stalwart veteran, bearded, and with a voice of command.\n",
      "when they  ----  introduced to a small red-haired boy with a lisp, they refused to take him seriously.\n",
      "in england youth  ----  an unpardonable thing.\n",
      "but, in spite of a vigorous c ---- paign, in which lady randolph took an active part, oldham decided it was not ready to accept young churchill for a member.\n",
      "later he was oldh ---- 's only claim to fame.\n",
      "a week after he  ----  defeated he sailed for south africa, where war with the boers was imminent.\n",
      "he had resigned from h ----  regiment and went south as war correspondent for the _morning post_.\n",
      "later in the war he held a commission as lieutenant in the south african light horse, a regiment of irregular cavalry, and on the staffs of different generals acted as galloper and aide-de-c ---- p.\n",
      "to this combination of duties, which was in direct violation of a rule of the war office, his brother officers and his fellow correspondents objected; but, as in each of his other c ---- paigns he had played this dual role, the press censors considered it a traditional privilege, and winked at it.\n",
      "as a matter of record, churchill's soldiering never seemed to interfere with h ----  writing, nor, in a fight, did his duty to his paper ever prevent him from mixing in as a belligerent.\n",
      "war was decl ---- d october 9th, and only a month later, while scouting in the armored train along the railroad line between pietermaritzburg and colenso, the cars were derailed and churchill was taken prisoner.\n",
      "the train  ----  made up of three flat cars, two armored cars, and between them the engine, with three cars coupled to the cow-catcher and two to the tender.\n",
      "on the outward trip the boers did not show themselves, but as soon as the english passed frere station they rolled a rock on the track at a point where it  ----  hidden by a curve.\n",
      "on the return trip, as the engl ---- h approached this curve the boers opened fire with artillery and pompoms.\n",
      "the engineer, in h ----  eagerness to escape, rounded the curve at full speed, and, as the boers had expected, hit the rock.\n",
      "the three forward cars  ----  derailed, and one of them was thrown across the track, thus preventing the escape of the engine and the two rear cars.\n",
      "from these captain haldane, who  ----  in command, with a detachment of the dublins, kept up a steady fire on the enemy, while churchill worked to clear the track.\n",
      "to ass ---- t him he had a company of natal volunteers, and those who had not run away of the train hands and break-down crew.\n",
      "\"we  ----  not long left in the comparative safety of a railroad accident,\" churchill writes to his paper.\n",
      "\"the boers' guns, swiftly changing their position, reopened fire from a distance of thirteen hundred yards before any one had got out of the stage of excl ---- ations.\n",
      "the tapping rifle-fire spread along the hills, until it encircled the wreckage on three sides, and from some high ground on the opposite side of the line a third field-gun c ---- e into action.\"\n",
      "for boer marksmen with mausers and pompoms, a wrecked railroad train at thirteen hundred yards was as easy a bull's-eye as the hands of the first baseman to the pitcher, and while the engine butted and snorted and the men with their bare bands tore at the massive be ---- s of the freight-car, the bullets and shells beat about them.\n",
      "\"i have had in the last four years many strange and varied experiences,\" continues young churchill, \"but nothing was so thrilling as this; to wait and struggle  ---- ong these clanging, rending iron boxes, with the repeated explosions of the shells, the noise of the projectiles striking the cars, the hiss as they passed in the air, the grunting and puffing of the engine--poor, tortured thing, hammered by at least a dozen shells, any one of which, by penetrating the boiler, might have made an end of all--the expectation of destruction as a matter of course, the realization of powerlessness--all this for seventy minutes by the clock, with only four inches of twisted iron between danger, captivity, and shame on one side--and freedom on the other.\"\n",
      "the \"protected\" train had proved a deathtrap, and by the time the line  ----  clear every fourth man was killed or wounded.\n",
      " ---- ong those left behind, a tommy, without authority, raised a handkerchief on his rifle, and the boers instantly ceased firing and came galloping forward to accept surrender.\n",
      "there was a general st ---- pede to escape.\n",
      "seeing that lieutenant franklin  ----  gallantly trying to hold his men, churchill, who was safe on the engine, jumped from it and ran to his assistance.\n",
      "of what followed, th ----  is his own account: \"scarcely had the locomotive left me than i found myself alone in a shallow cutting, and none of our soldiers, who had all surrendered, to be seen.\n",
      "then suddenly there appe ---- d on the line at the end of the cutting two men not in uniform.\n",
      "i turned and ran between the rails of the track, and the only thought i achieved  ----  this: 'boer marksmanship.'\n",
      "another glance at the figures; one  ----  now kneeling to aim.\n",
      "again two soft k ---- ses sucked in the air, but nothing struck me.\n",
      "i must get out of the cutting--that d ---- nable corridor.\n",
      "i scr ---- bled up the bank.\n",
      "the earth sprang up beside me, and a bullet touched my hand, but outside the cutting  ----  a tiny depression.\n",
      "i crouched in th ---- , struggling to get my wind.\n",
      "on the other side of the railway a horseman galloped up, shouting to me and waving h ----  hand.\n",
      "he  ----  scarcely forty yards off.\n",
      "i reached down for my mauser p ---- tol.\n",
      "between me and the horseman there  ----  a wire fence.\n",
      "death stood before me, grim and sullen; death without h ----  light-hearted companion, chance.\n",
      "then i was herded with the other prisoners in a miserable group, and about the s ---- e time i noticed that my hand was bleeding, and it began to pour with rain.\n",
      "\"two days before i had written to an officer at home: 'there has been a great deal too much surrendering in th ----  war, and i hope people who do so will not be encouraged.'\"\n",
      "with other officers, churchill  ----  imprisoned in the state model schools, situated in the heart of pretoria.\n",
      "it  ----  distinctly characteristic that on the very day of his arrival he began to plan to escape.\n",
      "toward this end his first step was to lose his c ---- paign hat, which he recognized was too obviously the hat of an english officer.\n",
      "before his chance to escape c ---- e a month elapsed, and the opportunity that then offered was less an opportunity to escape than to get himself shot.\n",
      "the state model schools  ----  surrounded by the children's playgrounds, penned in by a high wall, and at night, while they were used as a prison, brilliantly lighted by electric lights.\n",
      "after many nights of observation, churchill discovered that while the sentries  ----  pacing their beats there was a moment when to them a certain portion of the wall was in darkness.\n",
      "this  ----  due to cross-shadows cast by the electric lights.\n",
      "on the other side of this wall there  ----  a private house set in a garden filled with bushes.\n",
      "beyond this  ----  the open street.\n",
      "to scale the wall was not difficult; the real danger lay in the fact that at no time  ----  the sentries farther away than fifteen yards, and the chance of being shot by one or both of them was excellent.\n",
      "to a brother officer churchill confided his purpose, and together they agreed that some night when the sentries had turned from the dark spot on the wall they would scale it and drop  ---- ong the bushes in the garden.\n",
      "after they reached the garden, should they reach it alive, what they  ----  to do they did not know.\n",
      "how they were to proceed through the streets and out of the city, how they were to pass unchallenged under its many electric lights and before the illuminated shop windows, how to dodge patrols, and how to find their way through two hundred and eighty miles of a south african wilderness, through an utterly unf ---- iliar, unfriendly, and sparsely settled country into portuguese territory and the coast, they left to chance.\n",
      "but with luck they hoped to cover the d ---- tance in a fortnight, begging corn at the kaffir kraals, sleeping by day, and marching under cover of the darkness.\n",
      "they agreed to make the attempt on the 11th of december, but on that night the sentries did not move from the only part of the wall that  ----  in shadow.\n",
      "anything  ----  better than further suspense.\n",
      "again night c ---- e.\n",
      "again the dinner  ---- ll sounded.\n",
      "then suddenly one turned and walked up to h ----  comrade and they began to talk.\n",
      "their backs  ----  turned.\n",
      "twice i let myself down again in sickly hesitation, and then with a third resolve scr ---- bled up.\n",
      "the top  ----  flat.\n",
      "then i lowered myself into the adjoining garden and crouched  ---- ong the shrubs.\n",
      "i  ----  free.\n",
      "the first step had been taken, and it  ----  irrevocable.\"\n",
      "churchill discovered that the house into the garden of which he had so unceremoniously introduced himself  ----  brilliantly lighted, and that the owner was giving a party.\n",
      "thinking h ----  companion might yet join him, for an hour he crouched in the bushes, until from the other side of the wall he heard the voices of his friend and of another officer.\n",
      "h ----  friend whispered.\n",
      "the two voices drew ne ---- r.\n",
      "to confuse the sentries, should they be l ---- tening, the one officer talked nonsense, laughed loudly, and quoted latin phrases, while the other, in a low and distinct voice, said: \"i cannot get out.\n",
      "to go back  ----  impossible.\n",
      "churchill now felt that in any case he  ----  sure to be recaptured, and decided he would, as he expresses it, at least have a run for his money.\n",
      "\"i shall go on alone,\" he wh ---- pered.\n",
      "he heard the footsteps of h ----  two friends move away from him across the play yard.\n",
      "at the s ---- e moment he stepped boldly out into the garden and, passing the open windows of the house, walked down the gravel path to the street.\n",
      "most of those guarding the school-house knew him by sight, but churchill did not turn h ----  head, and whether the sentry recognized him or not, he could not tell.\n",
      "his nerves  ----  leaping, his heart in his throat, his spine of water.\n",
      "and then, as he continued to advance, and still no tumult pursued him, he quickened h ----  pace and turned into one of the main streets of pretoria.\n",
      "the sidewalks  ----  crowded with burghers, but no one noticed him.\n",
      "this was due probably to the fact that the boers wore no distinctive uniform, and that with them in their commandoes were many english colonials who wore khaki riding breeches, and many  ---- ericans, french, germans, and russians, in every fashion of semi-uniform.\n",
      "if observed, churchill  ----  mistaken for one of these, and the very openness of his movements saved him from suspicion.\n",
      "as he had no map or compass he knew th ----  must be his only guide, but he knew also that two railroads left pretoria, the one along which he had been captured, to pietermaritzburg, and the other, the one leading to the coast and freedom.\n",
      "which of the two this one  ----  he had no idea, but he took his chance, and a hundred yards beyond a station waited for the first outgoing train.\n",
      "about midnight, a freight stopped at the station, and after it had left it and  ---- fore it had again gathered headway, churchill swung himself up upon it, and stretched out upon a pile of coal.\n",
      "throughout the night the train continued steadily toward the east, and so told him that it  ----  the one he wanted, and that he was on his way to the neutral territory of portugal.\n",
      "fearing the daylight, just before the sun rose, as the train  ----  pulling up a steep grade, he leaped off into some bushes.\n",
      "as all stations and bridges  ----  guarded, he had to make long detours, and the tropical moonlight prevented him from crossing in the open.\n",
      "in th ----  way, sleeping by day, walking by night, begging food from the kaffirs, five days passed.\n",
      "meanwhile, his absence had been at once discovered, and, by the boers, every effort  ----  being made to retake him.\n",
      "telegr ---- s giving his description were sent along both railways, three thousand photographs of him were distributed, each car of every train was searched, and in different parts of the transvaal men who resembled him were being arrested.\n",
      "it  ----  said he had escaped dressed as a woman; in the uniform of a transvaal policeman whom he had bribed; that he had never left pretoria, and that in the disguise of a waiter he was concealed in the house of a british sympathizer.\n",
      "on the strength of this rumor the houses of all suspected persons  ----  searched.\n",
      "in the volksstem it  ----  pointed out as a significant fact that a week before his escape churchill had drawn from the library mill's \"essay on liberty.\"\n",
      "in england and over all brit ---- h south africa the escape created as much interest as it did in pretoria.\n",
      "because the attempt showed pluck, and because he had outwitted the enemy, churchill for the time bec ---- e a sort of popular hero, and to his countrymen his escape gave as much pleasure as it was a cause of chagrin to the boers.\n",
      "but as days passed and nothing was heard of him, it was fe ---- d he had lost himself in the machadodorp mountains, or had succumbed to starvation, or, in the jungle toward the coast, to fever, and congratulations gave way to anxiety.\n",
      "the anxiety  ----  justified, for at this time churchill was in a very bad way.\n",
      "during the month in pr ---- on he had obtained but little exercise.\n",
      "the lack of food and of water, the cold by night and the terrific heat by day, the long stumbling marches in the darkness, the mental effect upon an extremely nervous, high-strung organization of being hunted, and of having to hide from h ----  fellow men, had worn him down to a condition almost of collapse.\n",
      "even though it were neutral soil, in so exhausted a state he dared not venture into the sw ---- ps and waste places of the portuguese territory; and, sick at heart as well as sick in body, he saw no choice left him save to give himself up.\n",
      "but before doing so he c ---- fully prepared a tale which, although most improbable, he hoped might still conceal his identity and aid him to escape by train across the border.\n",
      "utterly unable to proceed further, he crawled to the ne ---- st zinc-roofed shack, and, fully prepared to surrender, knocked at the door.\n",
      "it was opened by a rough-looking, bearded giant, the first white man to whom in many days churchill had d ---- d address himself.\n",
      "to him, without hope, he feebly st ---- mered forth the speech he had rehearsed.\n",
      "the man l ---- tened with every outward mark of disbelief.\n",
      "at churchill himself he st ---- d with open suspicion.\n",
      "\"you are winston churchill, and i-- ----  the only englishman in this village.\"\n",
      "the rest of the adventure  ----  comparatively easy.\n",
      "the next night his friend in need, an engineer n ---- ed howard, smuggled churchill into a freight-car, and hid him under sacks of some soft merchandise.\n",
      "at komatie-poort, the station on the border, for eighteen hours the car in which churchill lay concealed  ----  left in the sun on a siding, and before it again started it was searched, but the man who was conducting the search lifted only the top layer of sacks, and a few minutes later churchill heard the hollow roar of the car as it passed over the bridge, and knew that he was across the border.\n",
      "when at last he arrived in lorenzo marques he at once sought out the engl ---- h consul, who, after first mistaking him for a stoker from one of the ships in the harbor, gave him a drink, a bath, and a dinner.\n",
      "as good luck would have it, the _induna_ was leaving that night for durban, and, escorted by a body-guard of english residents armed with revolvers, and who  ----  taking no chances of his recapture by the boer agents, he was placed safely on board.\n",
      "two days later he arrived at durban, where he  ----  received by the mayor, the populace, and a brass band playing: \"britons never, never, never shall be slaves!\"\n",
      "for the next month churchill was bombarded by letters and telegr ---- s from every part of the globe, some invited him to command filibustering expeditions, others sent him woollen comforters, some forwarded photographs of himself to be signed, others photographs of themselves, possibly to be admired, others sent poems, and some bottles of whiskey.\n",
      "one admirer wrote: \"my congratulations on your wonderful and glorious deeds, which will send such a thrill of pride and enthusiasm through great britain and the united states of  ---- erica, that the anglo-saxon race will be irresistible.\"\n",
      "lest so large an order as making the anglo-saxon race irresistible might turn the head of a subaltern, an antiseptic cablegr ----  was also sent him, from london, reading: \"best friends here hope you won't go making further ass of yourself.\n",

      "the few months that intervened between his election and the opening of the new parli ---- ent were snatched by churchill for a lecturing tour at home, and in the united states and canada.\n",
      "his subject  ----  the war and his escape from pretoria.\n",
      "when he c ---- e to this country half of the people here were in sympathy with the boers, and did not care to listen to what they supposed would be a strictly british version of the war.\n",
      "his manager, without asking permission of those whose n ---- es he advertised, organized for churchill's first appearance in various cities, different reception committees.\n",
      "some of those whose n ---- es, without their consent, were used for these committees, wrote indignantly to the papers, saying that while for churchill, personally, they held every respect, they objected to being used to advertise an anti-boer demonstration.\n",

      "in his own mind there was app ---- ntly no doubt.\n",
      "after he had taken the oath, signed his n ---- e, and shaken the hand of the speaker, without hesitation he seated himself on the bench next to the ministry.\n",
      "ten minutes later, so a newspaper of the day describes it, he had cocked his hat over his eyes, shoved his hands into his trousers pockets, and  ----  lolling back eying the veterans of the house with critical disapproval.\n",

      "a. p._ he wrote: \"i  ----  inclined to think that the dash of american blood which he has from his mother has been an improvement on the original stock, and that mr. winston churchill may turn out to be a stronger and abler politician than his father.\"\n",
      "it was all a part of churchill's \"luck\" that when he entered parli ---- ent the subject in debate was the conduct of the war.\n",
      "even in those first days of his c ---- er in the house, in debates where angels feared to tread, he did not hesitate to rush in, but this subject was one on which he spoke with knowledge.\n",
      "over the older men who  ----  forced to quote from hearsay or from what they had read, churchill had the tremendous advantage of being able to protest: \"you only read of that.\n",

      "in the house he bec ---- e at once one of the conspicuous and picturesque figures, one dear to the heart of the caricaturist, and one from the strangers' gallery most frequently pointed out.\n",

      "of him and of h ----  recruits in south africa, churchill spoke with the awful frankness of the _enfant terrible_.\n",
      "and although he addressed them more with sorrow than with anger, to balfour and ch ---- berlain he daily administered advice and reproof, while mere generals and field-marshals, like kitchener and roberts, blushing under new titles, were held up for public reproof and briefly but severely chastened.\n",
      "nor, when he saw lord sal ---- bury going astray, did he hesitate in his duty to the country, but took the prime minister by the hand and gently instructed him in the way he should go.\n",
      "th ----  did not tend to make him popular, but in spite of his unpopularity, in his speeches against national extravagancies he made so good a fight that he forced the government, unwillingly, to appoint a committee to investigate the need of economy.\n",
      "for a beginner this  ----  a distinct triumph.\n",
      "with lord hugh cecil, lord percy, ian malcolm, and other clever young men, he formed inside the conservative party a little group that in its obstructive and independent methods  ----  not unlike the fourth party of his father.\n",
      "from its leader and its filibustering, guerilla-like tactics the men who composed it were nickn ---- ed the \"hughligans.\"\n",
      "the hughligans were the most active critics of the ministry and of all in their own party, and as members of the free food league they bitterly attacked the fiscal proposals of mr. ch ---- berlain.\n",
      "when balfour made ch ---- berlain's fight for fair trade, or for what virtually was protection, a measure of the conservatives, the lines of party began to break, and men were no longer conservatives or liberals, but protectionists or free traders.\n",

      "just before the easter vacation of that year, when he rose to speak a remarkable demonstration  ----  made against him by his unionist colleagues, all of them rising and leaving the house.\n",
      "to the liberals who remained to hear him he stated that if to his constituents his opinions  ----  obnoxious, he was ready to resign his seat.\n",
      "it then  ----  evident he would go over to the liberal party.\n",
      "some thought he foresaw which way the tidal wave  ----  coming, and to being slapped down on the beach and buried in the sand, he preferred to be swept forward on its crest.\n",
      "others believed he left the conservatives because he could not honestly stomach the taxed food offered by mr. ch ---- berlain.\n",
      "in any event, if he were to be bl ---- ed for changing from one party to the other, he was only following the distinguished example set him by gladstone, disraeli, harcourt, and his own father.\n",
      "it was at the time of this change that he was called \"the best hated man in england,\" but the liberals welcomed him gladly, and the national liberal club paid him the r ----  compliment of giving in his honor a banquet.\n",
      "there  ----  present two hundred members.\n",
      "up to that time this dinner  ----  the most marked testimony to his importance in the political world.\n",
      "it  ----  about then, a year since, that he prophesied: \"within nine months there will come such a tide and deluge as will sweep through england and scotland, and completely wash out and effect a much-needed spring cleaning in downing street.\"\n",
      "when the deluge c ---- e, at manchester, mr. balfour was defeated, and churchill was victorious, and when the new government was formed the tidal wave landed churchill in the office of under-secretary for the colonies.\n",
      "while th ----  is being written the english papers say that within a month he again will be promoted.\n",

      "captain philo norton mcgiffin in the chinese-japanese war the battle of the yalu  ----  the first battle fought between warships of modern make, and, except on paper, neither the men who made them nor the men who fought them knew what the ships could do, or what they might not do.\n",
      "for years every naval power had been building these new engines of war, and in the battle which  ----  to test them the whole world was interested.\n",
      "but in this battle  ---- ericans had a special interest, a human, family interest, for the reason that one of the chinese squadron, which was matched against some of the same vessels of japan which lately swept those of russia from the sea, was commanded by a young graduate of the american naval academy.\n",
      "this young man, who, at the time of the battle of the yalu,  ----  thirty-three years old, was captain philo norton mcgiffin.\n",
      "so it appears that five years before our fleet sailed to victory in manila bay another graduate of annapolis, and one twenty years younger than in 1898 was admiral dewey, had commanded in action a modern battleship, which, in tonnage, in arm ---- ent, and in the number of the ships' company, far outclassed dewey's _olympia_.\n",
      "mcgiffin, who was born on december 13, 1860, c ---- e of fighting stock.\n",
      "back in scotland the f ---- ily is descended from the clan macgregor and the clan macalpine.\n",
      "\"these are clan-alpine's warriors true, and, saxon--i  ----  roderick dhu.\"\n",
      "mcgiffin's great-grandfather, born in scotland, emigrated to this country and settled in \"little  ---- hington,\" near pittsburg, pa. in the revolutionary war he was a soldier.\n",
      "other relatives fought in the war of 1812, one of them holding a comm ---- sion as major.\n",
      "mcgiffin's own father  ----  colonel norton mcgiffin, who served in the mexican war, and in the civil war was lieutenant-colonel of the eighty-fifth pennsylvania volunteers.\n",
      "so mcgiffin inherited h ----  love for arms.\n",
      "in  ---- hington he went to the high school and at the washington jefferson college had passed through his freshman year.\n",
      "but the honors that might accrue to him if he continued to live on in the quiet and pretty old town of  ---- hington did not tempt him.\n",
      "to escape into the world he wrote h ----  congressman, begging him to obtain for him an appointment to annapolis.\n",
      "the congressman liked the letter, and wrote colonel mcgiffin to ask if the application of h ----  son had his approval.\n",
      "colonel mcgiffin  ----  willing, and in 1877 his son received his commission as cadet midshipman.\n",
      "i knew mcgiffin only as a boy with whom in vacation time i went coon hunting in the woods outside of  ---- hington.\n",
      "for his age he was a very tall boy, and in his midshipman undress uniform, to my youthful eyes, appe ---- d a most bold and adventurous spirit.\n",
      "at annapolis his record seems to show he  ----  pretty much like other boys.\n",
      "according to his classmates, with all of whom i find he was very popular, he stood high in the practical studies, such as se ---- anship, gunnery, navigation, and steam engineering, but in all else he was near the foot of the class, and in whatever escapade was risky and reckless he was always one of the leaders.\n",
      "to him discipline  ----  extremely irksome.\n",
      "he could maintain it  ---- ong others, but when it applied to himself it bored him.\n",
      "on the floor of the academy building on which was his room there was a pyr ---- id of cannon balls--relics of the war of 1812. they stood at the head of the stairs, and one warm night, when he could not sleep, he decided that no one else should do so, and, one by one, rolled the cannon balls down the stairs.\n",
      "they tore away the ban ---- ters and bumped through the wooden steps and leaped off into the lower halls.\n",
      "for any one who might think of ascending to discover the motive power back of the bombardment they  ----  extremely dangerous.\n",
      "but an officer approached mcgiffin in the rear, and, having been caught in the act, he  ----  sent to the prison ship.\n",
      "there he made good friends with his jailer, an old man-of-warsman n ---- ed \"mike.\"\n",
      "he will  ----  remembered by many naval officers who as midshipmen served on the _santee_.\n",
      "it aroused the entire garrison, and for a week the empty window fr ---- es kept the glaziers busy.\n",
      "about 1878 or 1879 there was a f ---- ine in ireland.\n",
      "the people of new york city contributed prov ---- ions for the sufferers, and to carry the supplies to ireland the government authorized the use of the old _constellation_.\n",
      "at the time the voyage  ----  to begin each cadet was instructed to consider himself as having been placed in command of the _constellation_ and to write a report on the preparations made for the voyage, on the loading of the vessel, and on the distribution of the stores.\n",
      "this exercise was intended for the instruction of the cadets; first in the matter of se ---- anship and navigation, and second in making official reports.\n",
      "at that time it  ----  a very difficult operation to get a gun out of the port of a vessel where the gun was on a covered deck.\n",
      "to do th ----  the necessary tackles had to be rigged from the yard-arm and the yard and mast properly braced and stayed, and then the lower block of the tackle carried in through the gun port, which, of course, gave the fall a very bad reeve.\n",
      "the first part of mcgiffin's report dealt with a new method of dismounting the guns and carrying them through the gun ports, and so admirable was his plan, so simple and ingenious, that it was used whenever it bec ---- e necessary to dismount a gun from one of the old sailing ships.\n",
      "having, however, offered this piece of good work, mcgiffin's report proceeded to tell of the division of the ship into compartments that  ----  filled with a miscellaneous assortment of stores, which included the old \"fifteen puzzles,\" at that particular time very popular.\n",
      "the report terminated with a description of the joy of the f ---- ished irish as they received the puzzle-boxes.\n",
      "at another time the cadets were required to write a report telling of the suppression of the insurrection on the isthmus of pan ---- a.\n",
      "mcgiffin won great praise for the military arrangements and disposition of his men, but, in the s ---- e report, he went on to describe how he armed them with a new gun known as baines's rhetoric and told of the havoc he wrought in the enemy's ranks when he fired these guns loaded with similes and metaphors and hyperboles.\n",
      "of course, after each exhibition of this sort he  ----  sent to the _santee_ and given an opportunity to meditate.\n",
      "on another occasion, when one of the instructors lectured to the cadets, he required them to submit a written statement embodying all that they could recall of what had  ----  said at the lecture.\n",
      "one of the rules concerning this report provided that there should be no erasures or interlineations, but that when mistakes were made the objectionable or incorrect expressions should be included within p ---- ntheses; and that the matter so enclosed within parentheses would not be considered a part of the report.\n",
      "mcgiffin wrote an excellent _resume_ of the lecture, but he interspersed through it in p ---- ntheses such words as \"applause,\" \"cheers,\" \"cat-calls,\" and \"groans,\" and as these words were enclosed within parentheses he insisted that they did not count, and made a very fair plea that he ought not to be punished for words which slipped in by mistake, and which he had officially obliterated by what he called oblivion marks.\n",
      "he  ----  not always on mischief bent.\n",
      "on one occasion, when the house of a professor caught fire, mcgiffin ran into the fl ---- es and carried out two children, for which act he was commended by the secretary of the navy.\n",
      "it was an act of congress that determined that the c ---- er of mcgiffin should be that of a soldier of fortune.\n",
      "this was a most unjust act, which provided that only as many midshipmen should receive commissions as on the warships there  ----  actual vacancies.\n",
      "in those days, in 1884, our navy  ----  very small.\n",
      "to-day there  ----  hardly a ship having her full complement of officers, and the difficulty is not to get rid of those we have educated, but to get officers to educate.\n",
      "to the many boys who, on the promise that they would be officers of the navy, had worked for four years at the academy and served two years at sea, the act  ----  most unfair.\n",
      "out of a class of about ninety, only the first twelve  ----  given commissions and the remaining eighty turned adrift upon the uncertain seas of civil life.\n",
      "as a sop, each  ----  given one thousand dollars.\n",
      "mcgiffin  ----  not one of the chosen twelve.\n",
      "in the final ex ---- inations on the list he was well toward the tail.\n",
      "but without having studied many things, and without remembering the greater part of them, no one graduates from annapolis, even last on the list; and with his one thousand dollars in cash, mcgiffin had also this six years of education at what  ----  then the best naval college in the world.\n",
      "this  ----  his only asset--his education--and as in his own country it was impossible to dispose of it, for possible purchasers he looked abroad.\n",
      "at that time the tong king war  ----  on between france and china, and he decided, before it grew rusty, to offer his knowledge to the followers of the yellow dragon.\n",
      "in those days that  ----  a hazard of new fortunes that meant much more than it does now.\n",
      "to-day the east  ----  as near as san francisco; the japanese-russian war, our occupation of the philippines, the part played by our troops in the boxer trouble, have made the affairs of china part of the daily reading of every one.\n",
      "now, one can step into a brass bed at forty-second street and in four days at the coast get into another brass bed, and in twelve more be spinning down the bund of yokoh ---- a in a rickshaw.\n",
      "but in 1885 it was no such light undertaking, certainly not for a young man who had been brought up in the quiet atmosphere of an inland town, where generations of his f ---- ily and other families had lived and intermarried, content with their surroundings.\n",
      "with very few of h ----  thousand dollars left him, mcgiffin arrived in february, 1885, in san francisco.\n",
      "from there his letters to his f ---- ily give one the picture of a healthy, warm-hearted youth, chiefly anxious lest his mother and sister should \"worry.\"\n",
      "in our country nearly every f ---- ily knows that domestic tragedy when the son and heir \"breaks home ties,\" and starts out to earn a living; and if all the world loves a lover, it at least sympathizes with the boy who is \"looking for a job.\"\n",
      "the boy who is looking for the job may not think so, but each of those who has passed through the s ---- e hard place gives him, if nothing else, his good wishes.\n",
      "mcgiffin's letters at th ----  period gain for him from those who have had the privilege to read them the warmest good feeling.\n",
      "they are filled with the s ---- e cheery optimism, the same slurring over of his troubles, the same homely jokes, the same assurances that he is feeling \"bully,\" and that it all will come out right, that every boy, when he starts out in the world, sends back to his mother.\n",
      "\"i  ----  in first-rate health and spirits, so i don't want you to fuss about me.\n",
      "i  ----  big enough and ugly enough to scratch along somehow, and i will not starve.\"\n",
      "to his mother he proudly sends his n ---- e written in chinese characters, as he had been taught to write it by the chinese consul-general in san francisco, and a pen-picture of two elephants.\n",
      "\"i  ----  going to bring you home _two_ of these,\" he writes, not knowing that in the strange and wonderful country to which he is going elephants are as infrequent as they are in pittsburg.\n",
      "he reached china in april, and from nagasaki on his way to shanghai the ste ---- er that carried him was chased by two french gunboats.\n",
      "but, app ---- ntly much to his disappointment, she soon ran out of range of their guns.\n",

      "almost all of those who in the chinese-japanese war served as officers  ----  his pupils.\n",
      "as the navy grew, he grew with it, and h ----  position increased in importance.\n",
      "more mexican dollars per month, more servants, larger houses, and buttons of various honorable colors  ----  given him, and, in return, he established for china a modern naval college patterned after our own.\n",
      "in those days throughout china and japan you could find many of these foreign adv ---- ers.\n",
      "w. h. dennison of the foreign office, one of our own people, is the only foreigner with whom the japanese have not parted, and in china there  ----  none.\n",
      "of all of those who have gone none served h ----  employers more faithfully than did mcgiffin.\n",
      "at a time when every official robbed the people and the government, and when \"squeeze\" or \"graft\" was recognized as a perquisite, mcgiffin's hands  ----  clean.\n",
      "the shells purchased for the government by him  ----  not loaded with black sand, nor were the rifles fitted with barrels of iron pipe.\n",
      "once a year he celebrated the thanksgiving day of his own country by inviting to a great dinner all the chinese naval officers who had been at least in part educated in  ---- erica.\n",
      "it  ----  a great occasion, and to enjoy it officers used to come from as far as port arthur, shanghai, and hong-kong.\n",
      "so fully did some of them appreciate the efforts of their host that previous to h ----  annual dinner, for twenty-four hours, they delicately starved themselves.\n",
      "during ten years mcgiffin served as naval constructor and professor of gunnery and se ---- anship, and on board ships at sea gave practical demonstrations in the handling of the new cruisers.\n",
      "in 1894 he applied for leave, which was granted, but before he had sailed for home war with japan was decl ---- d and he withdrew his application.\n",
      "he  ----  placed as second in command on board the _chen yuen_, a seven-thousand-ton battleship, a sister ship to the _ting yuen_, the flagship of admiral ting ju chang.\n",
      "on the memorable 17th of september, 1894, the battle of the yalu was fought, and so badly were the chinese vessels h ---- mered that the chinese navy, for the time being, was wiped out of existence.\n",
      "from the start the advantage  ----  with the japanese fleet.\n",
      "in heavy guns the chinese  ----  the better armed, but in quick-firing guns the japanese were vastly superior, and while the chinese battleships _ting yuen_ and _chen yuen_, each of 7,430 tons, were superior to any of the japanese warships, the three largest of which were each of 4,277 tons, the gross tonnage of the japanese fleet was 36,000 to 21,000 of the chinese.\n",
      "during the progress of the battle the ships engaged on each side numbered an even dozen, but at the very start, before a decisive shot was fired by either contestant, the _tsi yuen_, 2,355 tons, and _kwan chiae_, 1,300 tons, ran away, and before they had time to get into the g ---- e the _chao yung_ and _yang wei_ were in flames and had fled to the nearest land.\n",
      "so the battle  ----  fought by eight chinese ships against twelve of the japanese.\n",
      "of the chinese vessels, the flagship, commanded by admiral ting, and her sister ship, which immediately after the beginning of the fight was for four hours commanded by mcgiffin,  ----  the two chief aggressors, and in consequence received the fire of the entire japanese squadron.\n",
      "the japanese themselves testified that these two ships never lost their formation, and that when her sister ironclad  ----  closely pressed the _chen yuen_, by her movements and gun practice, protected the _ting yuen_, and, in fact, while she could not prevent the heavy loss the fleet encountered, preserved it from annihilation.\n",
      "during the fight this ship  ----  almost continuously on fire, and was struck by every kind of projectile, from the thirteen-inch canet shells to a rifle bullet, four hundred times.\n",
      "mcgiffin himself was so badly wounded, so beaten about by concussions, so burned, and so bruised by steel splinters, that his health and eyesight  ----  forever wrecked.\n",
      "on account of his lack of health he resigned from the chinese service and returned to  ---- erica.\n",
      "for two years he lived in new york city, suffering in body without cessation the most exqu ---- ite torture.\n",
      "during that time his letters to his f ---- ily show only tremendous courage.\n",
      "on the splintered, gaping deck of the _chen yuen_, with the fires below it, and the shells bursting upon it, he had shown to his chinese crew the courage of the white man who knew he  ----  responsible for them and for the honor of their country.\n",
      "but far greater and more difficult  ----  the courage he showed while alone in the dark sick-room, and in the private wards of the hospitals.\n",
      "in the letters he dictates from there he still is concerned only lest those at home shall \"worry\"; he reassures them with falsehoods, jokes at their fears; of the people he can see from the window of the hospital tells them foolish stories; for a little boy who has been kind he asks them to send him his chinese postage st ---- ps; he plans a trip he will take with them when he is stronger, knowing he never will be stronger.\n",
      "the doctors had urged upon him a certain operation, and of it to a friend he wrote: \"i know that i will have to have a piece about three inches squ ----  cut out of my skull, and this nerve cut off near the middle of the brain, as well as my eye taken out (for a couple of hours only, provided it is not mislaid, and can be found).\n",
      "doctor ------ and h ----  crowd show a bad memory for failures.\n",
      "as a result of th ----  operation others have told me--i forget the percentage of deaths, which does not matter, but--that a large percentage have become insane.\n",
      "while threatened with insanity and complete blindness, and hourly from h ----  wounds suffering a pain drugs could not master, he dictated for the _century magazine_ the only complete account of the battle of the yalu.\n",
      "in a letter to mr. richard watson gilder he writes: \"...my eyes  ----  troubling me.\n",
      "i cannot see even what i  ----  writing now, and am getting the article under difficulties.\n",
      "i yet hope to place it in your hands by the 21st, still, if my eyes grow worse------\" \"still, if my eyes grow worse------\" the unfinished sentence  ----  grimly prophetic.\n",
      "unknown to his attendants at the hospital,  ---- ong the papers in his despatch-box he had secreted his service revolver.\n",
      "on the morning of the 11th of february, 1897, he asked for th ----  box, and on some pretext sent the nurse from the room.\n",
      "when the report of the p ---- tol brought them running to his bedside, they found the pain-driven body at peace, and the tired eyes dark forever.\n",
      "in the article in the _century_ on the battle of the yalu, he had said: \"chief  ---- ong those who have died for their country is admiral ting ju chang, a gallant soldier and true gentleman.\n",
      "betrayed by his countrymen, fighting against odds, almost his last official act  ----  to stipulate for the lives of his officers and men.\n",

      "walker  ----  born in 1824, in nashville, tenn. he was the oldest son of a scotch banker, a man of a deeply religious mind, and interested in a business which certainly is removed, as far as possible, from the profession of arms.\n",
      "indeed, few men better than willi ----  walker illustrate the fact that great generals are born, not trained.\n",
      "everything in walker's birth, f ---- ily tradition, and education pointed to his becoming a member of one of the \"learned\" professions.\n",
      "it  ----  the wish of his father that he should be a minister of the presbyterian church, and as a child he was trained with that end in view.\n",
      "he himself preferred to study medicine, and after graduating at the university of tennessee, at edinburgh he followed a course of lectures, and for two years travelled in europe, v ---- iting many of the great hospitals.\n",
      "then having thoroughly equipped himself to pract ---- e as a physician, after a brief return to his native city, and as short a stay in philadelphia, he took down his shingle forever, and proceeded to new orleans to study law.\n",
      "in two years he  ----  admitted to the bar of louisiana.\n",
      "but because clients were few, or because the red tape of the law chafed his spirit, within a year, as already he had abandoned the church and medicine, he abandoned his law practice and bec ---- e an editorial writer on the new orleans _crescent_.\n",
      "a year later the restlessness which had rebelled against the grave professions led him to the gold fields of california, and san franc ---- co.\n",
      "there, in 1852, at the age of only twenty-eight, as editor of the san francisco _herald_, walker began his real life which so soon  ----  to end in both disaster and glory.\n",
      "up to his twenty-eighth year, except in his restlessness, nothing in his life foreshadowed what  ----  to follow.\n",
      "negatively, by abandoning three separate callings, and in making it plain that a professional career did not appeal to him, walker had thrown a certain sidelight on his character; but actively he never had given any hint that under the thoughtful brow of the young doctor and lawyer there was a mind evolving schemes of empire, and an  ---- bition limited only by the two great oceans.\n",
      "walker's first adventure  ----  undoubtedly inspired by and in imitation of one which at the time of his arrival in san francisco had just been brought to a disastrous end.\n",
      "this  ----  the de boulbon expedition into mexico.\n",
      "the count gaston raoulx de raousset-boulbon was a young french nobleman and soldier of fortune, a _chasseur d'afrique_, a duellist, journalist, dre ---- er, who came to california to dig gold.\n",
      "baron harden-hickey, who was born in san francisco a few years after boulbon at the age of thirty was shot in mexico, also was inspired to dre ---- s of conquest by this same gentleman adventurer.\n",
      "boulbon  ----  a young man of large ideas.\n",
      "in the rapid growth of california he saw a threat to mexico and proposed to that government, as a \"buffer\" state  ---- tween the two republics, to form a french colony in the mexican state of sonora.\n",
      "sonora  ----  that part of mexico which directly joins on the south with our state of arizona.\n",
      "the president of mexico gave boulbon perm ---- sion to attempt this, and in 1852 he landed at guaymas in the gulf of california with two hundred and sixty well-armed frenchmen.\n",
      "the ostensible excuse of boulbon for thus invading foreign soil was his contract with the president under which his \"emigrants\"  ----  hired to protect other foreigners working in the \"restauradora\" mines from the attacks of apache indians from our own arizona.\n",
      "but there is evidence that back of boulbon  ----  the french government, and that he was attempting, in his small way, what later was attempted by maximilian, backed by a french army corps and louis napoleon, to establish in mexico an empire under french protection.\n",
      "for both the filibuster and the emperor the end was the s ---- e; to be shot by the fusillade against a church wall.\n",
      "in 1852, two years before boulbon's death, which was the finale to his second filibustering expedition into sonora, he wrote to a friend in paris: \"europeans  ----  disturbed by the growth of the united states.\n",
      "unless she be dismembered; unless a powerful rival be built up beside her (_i.e._, france in mexico),  ---- erica will become, through her commerce, her trade, her population, her geographical position upon two oceans, the inevitable mistress of the world.\n",
      "in ten years europe d ----  not fire a shot without her permission.\n",
      "as i write fifty  ---- ericans prepare to sail for mexico and go perhaps to victory.\n",
      "_voila les etats-un ---- _.\"\n",
      "these fifty  ---- ericans who, in the eyes of boulbon, threatened the peace of europe, were led by the ex-doctor, ex-lawyer, ex-editor, william walker, _aged twenty-eight years_.\n",
      "he accordingly sailed without it, announcing that, whether the mexican government asked him to do so or not, he would see that the women and children on the border of mexico and arizona  ----  protected from massacre by the indians.\n",
      "it will be remembered that when dr. j ---- eson raided the transvaal he also went to protect \"women and children\" from massacre by the boers.\n",
      "walker's explanation of h ----  expedition, in his own words, is as follows.\n",
      "he writes in the third person: \"what walker saw and heard satisfied him that a comparatively small body of  ---- ericans might gain a position on the sonora frontier and protect the families on the border from the indians, and such an act would be one of humanity whether or not sanctioned by the mexican government.\n",
      "the condition of the upper part of sonora was at that time, and still is [he was writing eight years later, in 1860], a disgrace to the civilization of the continent...and the people of the united states  ----  more immediately responsible before the world for the apache outrages.\n",
      "northern sonora was in fact, more under the dominion of the apaches than under the laws of mexico, and the contributions of the indians  ----  collected with greater regularity and certainty than the dues of the tax-gatherers.\n",
      "the state of this region furnished the best defence for any  ---- erican aiming to settle there without the formal consent of mexico; and, although political changes would certainly have followed the establishment of a colony, they might be justified by the plea that any social organization, no matter how secured, is preferable to that in which individuals and families are altogether at the mercy of savages.\"\n",
      "while at the time of j ---- eson's raid the women and children in danger of massacre from the boers were as many as there are snakes in ireland, at the time of walker's raid the women and children were in danger from the indians, who as enemies, as walker soon discovered, were as cruel and as greatly to be feared as he had described them.\n",
      "but it  ----  not to save women and children that walker sought to conquer the state of sonora.\n",
      "at the time of his expedition the great question of slavery  ----  acute; and if in the states next to be admitted to the union slavery was to be prohibited, the time had come, so it seemed to this statesman of twenty-eight years, when the south must extend her boundaries, and for her slaves find an outlet in fresh territory.\n",
      "by conquest her territory could easily  ----  extended to meet texas.\n",
      "as a matter of fact, strategically the spot selected by willi ----  walker for the purpose for which he desired it was almost perfect.\n",
      "throughout his brief career one must remember that the spring of all his acts was this dre ----  of an empire where slavery would be recognized.\n",
      "his mother  ----  a slave-holder.\n",
      "in tennessee he had  ----  born and bred surrounded by slaves.\n",
      "h ----  youth and manhood had been spent in nashville and new orleans.\n",
      "he believed as honestly, as fanatically in the right to hold slaves as did h ----  father in the faith of the covenanters.\n",
      "to-day one reads h ----  arguments in favor of slavery with the most curious interest.\n",
      "his appeal to the humanity of his reader, to his heart, to his sense of justice, to his fear of god, and to his belief in the holy bible not to abolish slavery, but to continue it, to this generation is as  ---- using as the topsy-turvyisms of gilbert or shaw.\n",
      "but to the young man himself slavery  ----  a sacred institution, intended for the betterment of mankind, a god-given benefit to the black man and a god-given right of his white master.\n",
      "white brothers in the south, with perhaps less exalted motives, contributed funds to fit out walker's expedition, and in octo ---- r, 1852, with forty-five men, he landed at cape st. lucas, at the extreme point of lower california.\n",
      "lower california, it must be remembered, in spite of its n ---- e, is not a part of our california, but then was, and still is, a part of mexico.\n",
      "the fact that he  ----  at last upon the soil of the enemy caused walker to throw off all pretence; and instead of hastening to protect women and children, he sailed a few miles farther up the coast to la paz.\n",
      "with h ----  forty-five followers he raided the town, made the governor a prisoner, and established a republic with himself as president.\n",
      "in a procl ---- ation he declared the people free of the tyranny of mexico.\n",
      "they had no desire to be free, but walker  ----  determined, and, whether they liked it or not, they woke up to find themselves an independent republic.\n",
      "a few weeks later, although he had not yet set foot there, walker annexed on paper the state of sonora, and to both states gave the n ---- e of the republic of sonora.\n",
      "as soon as word of this reached san francisco, his friends busied themselves in his behalf, and the danger-loving and adventurous of all lands  ----  enlisted as \"emigrants\" and shipped to him in the bark _anita_.\n",
      "two months later, in novem ---- r, 1852, three hundred of these joined walker.\n",
      "they were as desperate a band of scoundrels as ever robbed a sluice, stoned a chin ---- an, or shot a \"greaser.\"\n",
      "when they found that to command them there was only a boy, they plotted to blow up the magazine in which the powder was stored, rob the c ---- p, and march north, supporting themselves by looting the ranches.\n",
      "with a force as absolutely undisciplined as  ----  his, the act required the most complete personal courage.\n",
      "that  ----  a quality the men with him could fully appreciate.\n",
      "they saw they had as a leader one who could fight, and one who would pun ---- h.\n",
      "the majority did not want a leader who would pun ---- h so when walker called upon those who would follow him to sonora to show their hands, only the original forty-five and about forty of the later recruits remained with him.\n",
      "from the very start the filibusters  ----  overwhelmed with disaster.\n",
      "men who in the almost daily encounters  ----  killed fell into the hands of the indians, and their bodies were mutilated.\n",
      "stragglers and deserters  ----  run to earth and tortured.\n",
      "those of the filibusters who were wounded died from lack of medical c ---- .\n",
      "the only instruments they possessed with which to extract the arrow-heads were probes made from r ---- rods filed to a point.\n",
      "their only food  ----  the cattle they killed on the march.\n",
      "the army was b ---- foot, the cabinet in rags, the president of sonora wore one boot and one shoe.\n",
      "unable to proceed farther, walker fell back upon san vincente, where he had left the arms and  ---- munition of the deserters and a rear-guard of eighteen men.\n",
      "a dozen had deserted, and the mexicans had surpr ---- ed the rest, lassoing them and torturing them until they died.\n",
      "to wait for further re-enforcements from san francisco, even  ----  he sure that re-enforcements would come, was impossible.\n",
      "he determined by forced marches to fight h ----  way to the boundary line of california.\n",
      "between him and safety  ----  the mexican soldiers holding the passes, and the indians hiding on his flanks.\n",
      "melendrez then  ---- gged the commander of the united states troops to order walker to surrender.\n",
      "major mckinstry, who  ----  in command of the united states army post at san diego, refused.\n",
      "for him to cross the line would  ----  a violation of neutral territory.\n",
      "on mexican soil he would neither embarrass the ex-president of sonora nor aid him; but he saw to it that if the filibusters reached  ---- erican soil, no mexican or indian should follow them.\n",
      "accordingly, on the imaginary boundary he drew up h ----  troop, and like an impartial umpire awaited the result.\n",
      "hidden behind rocks and cactus, across the hot, glaring plain, the filibusters could see the  ---- erican flag, and the gay, fluttering guidons of the cavalry.\n",
      "as he charged, walker, app ---- ntly routed, fled, but concealed in the rocks behind him he had stationed a rear-guard of a dozen men.\n",
      "as melendrez rode into this  ---- bush the dozen riflemen emptied as many saddles, and the mexicans and indians stampeded.\n",
      "a half hour later, footsore and f ---- ished, the little band that had set forth to found an empire of slaves, staggered across the line and surrendered to the forces of the united states.\n",
      "of this expedition j ---- es jeffrey roche says, in his \"byways of war,\" which is of all books published about walker the most intensely and fascinatingly interesting and complete: \"years afterward the peon herdsman or prowling cocupa indian in the mountain by-paths stumbled over the bleaching skeleton of some nameless one whose resting-place was marked by no cross or cairn, but the colts revolver resting beside his bones spoke his country and his occupation--the only relic of the would-be conquistadores of the nineteenth century.\"\n",
      "under parole to report to general wood, commanding the department of the pacific, the filibusters  ----  sent by sailing vessel to san francisco, where their leader was tried for violating the neutrality laws of the united states, and acquitted.\n",
      "walker's first expedition had ended in failure, but for him it had been an opportunity of tremendous experience, as active service is the best of all military academies, and for the kind of warf ----  he was to wage, the best preparation.\n",
      "nor was it inglorious, for his fellow survivors, contrary to the usual practice, instead of in bar-rooms placing the bl ---- e for failure upon their leader, stood ready to fight one and all who doubted his ability or his courage.\n",
      "later, after five years, many of these s ---- e men, though ten to twenty years his senior, followed him to death, and never questioned his judgment nor his right to command.\n",
      "at this time in nicaragua there  ----  the usual revolution.\n",
      "on the south the sister republic of costa rica  ----  taking sides, on the north honduras was landing arms and men.\n",
      "there  ----  no law, no government.\n",
      "in the editorial rooms of the san franc ---- co _herald_, walker, searching the map for new worlds to conquer, rested his finger upon nicaragua.\n",
      "in its confusion of authority he saw an opportunity to make himself a power, and in its tropical wealth and  ---- auty, in the laziness and incompetence of its inhabitants, he beheld a greater, fairer, more kind sonora.\n",
      "on the pacific side from san franc ---- co he could re-enforce his army with men and arms; on the caribbean side from new orleans he could, when the moment arrived, people his empire with slaves.\n",
      "the two parties at war in nicaragua  ----  the legitimists and the democrats.\n",
      "why they  ----  at war it is not necessary to know.\n",
      "probably walker did not know; it  ----  not likely that they themselves knew.\n",
      "but from the leader of the democrats walker obtained a contract to bring to nicaragua three hundred  ---- ericans, who were each to receive several hundred acres of land, and who were described as \"colonists liable to military duty.\"\n",
      "th ----  contract walker submitted to the attorney-general of the state and to general wood, who once before had acquitted him of filibustering; and neither of these federal officers saw anything which seemed to give them the right to interfere.\n",
      "but the rest of san francisco was less credulous, and the \"colonists\" who joined walker had a very distinct idea that they  ----  not going to nicaragua to plant coffee or to pick bananas.\n",
      "in may, 1855, just a year after walker and h ----  thirty-three followers had surrendered to the united states troops at san diego, with fifty new recruits and seven veterans of the former expedition he sailed from san francisco in the brig _vesta_, and in five weeks, after a weary and stormy voyage, landed at realejo.\n",
      "there he  ----  met by representatives of the provisional director of the democrats, who received the californians warmly.\n",
      "walker  ----  commissioned a colonel, achilles kewen, who had been fighting under lopez in cuba, a lieutenant-colonel, and timothy crocker, who had served under walker in the sonora expedition, a major.\n",
      "the corps was organized as an independent command and was n ---- ed \"la falange americana.\"\n",
      "at this time the enemy held the route to the caribbean, and walker's first orders  ----  to dislodge him.\n",
      "accordingly, a week after landing with his fifty-seven  ---- ericans and one hundred and fifty native troops, walker sailed in the _vesta_ for brito, from which port he marched upon rivas, a city of eleven thousand people and garrisoned by some twelve hundred of the enemy.\n",
      "the first fight ended in a complete and d ---- astrous fiasco.\n",
      "the native troops ran away, and the  ---- ericans surrounded by six hundred of the legitimists' soldiers, after defending themselves for three hours behind some adobe huts, charged the enemy and escaped into the jungle.\n",
      "their loss was heavy, and  ---- ong the killed were the two men upon whom walker chiefly depended: kewen and crocker.\n",
      "the legitimists placed the bodies of the dead and wounded who  ----  still living on a pile of logs and burned them.\n",
      "after a painful night march, walker, the next day, reached san juan on the coast, and, finding a costa rican schooner in port, seized it for h ----  use.\n",
      "at this moment, although walker's men  ----  defeated, bleeding, and in open flight, two \"gringos\" picked up on the beach of san juan, \"the texan harry mcleod and the irishman peter burns,\" asked to be permitted to join him.\n",
      "\"it  ----  encouraging,\" walker writes, \"for the soldiers to find that some besides themselves did not regard their fortunes as altogether desperate, and small as was this addition to their number it gave increased moral as well as material strength to the command.\"\n",
      "sometimes in reading h ---- tory it would appear as though for success the first requisite must be an utter lack of humor, and inability to look upon what one is attempting except with absolute seriousness.\n",
      "with forty men walker was planning to conquer and rule nicaragua, a country with a population of two hundred and fifty thousand souls and as large as the combined area of massachusetts, vermont, rhode island, new h ---- pshire, and connecticut.\n",
      "and yet, even seven years later, he records without a smile that two beach-combers gave h ----  army \"moral and material strength.\"\n",
      "and it is most characteristic of the man that at the moment he was rejoicing over this addition to his forces, to maintain discipline two  ---- ericans who had set fire to the houses of the enemy he ordered to be shot.\n",
      "a weaker man would have repudiated the two  ---- ericans, who, in fact, were not members of the phalanx, and trusted that their crimes would not be charged against him.\n",
      "but the success of walker lay greatly in h ----  stern discipline.\n",
      "one got away; and, as it might appear that walker had connived at his escape, to the second man  ----  shown no mercy.\n",
      "when one reads how severe was walker in his punishments, and how frequently the death penalty was invoked by him against his own few followers, the wonder grows that these men, as independent and as unaccustomed to restraint as  ----  those who first joined him, submitted to his leadership.\n",
      " ---- ong these reckless, fearless outlaws, who, despising their allies, believed and proved that with his rifle one american could account for a dozen nicaraguans, walker was the one man who did not boast or drink or gamble, who did not even swear, who never looked at a woman, and who, in money matters, was scrupulously honest and unself-seeking.\n",
      "in a fight, h ----  followers knew that for them he would risk being shot just as unconcernedly as to maintain his authority he would shoot one of them.\n",
      "treachery, cowardice, looting, any indignity to women, he punished with death; but to the wounded, either of his own or of the enemy's forces, he  ----  as gentle as a nursing sister and the brave and able he rewarded with instant promotion and higher pay.\n",
      "in no one trait  ----  he a demagogue.\n",
      "one can find no effort on h ----  part to ingratiate himself with his men.\n",
      " ---- ong the officers of his staff there were no favorites.\n",
      "in the face of injustice, perjury, or physical danger, he  ----  always calm, firm, dispassionate.\n",
      "but it  ----  said that on those infrequent occasions when his anger asserted itself, the steady steel-gray eyes flashed so menacingly that those who faced them would as soon look down the barrel of his colt.\n",
      "the impression one gets of him gathered from h ----  recorded acts, from his own writings, from the writings of those who fought with him, is of a silent, student-like young man believing religiously in his \"star of destiny\"; but, in all matters that did not concern himself, possessed of a grim sense of fun.\n",
      "the sayings of h ----  men that in his history of the war he records, show a distinct appreciation of the bret harte school of humor.\n",
      "as, for instance, when he tells how he wished to make one of them a drummer boy and the californian drawled: \"no, thanks, colonel; i never seen a picture of a battle yet that the first thing in it  ---- n't a dead drummer boy with a busted drum.\"\n",
      "in walker the personal vanity which is so characteristic of the soldier of fortune  ----  utterly lacking.\n",
      "in a land where a captain bedecks himself like a field-marshal, walker wore his trousers stuffed in his boots, a civilian's blue frock-coat, and the slouch hat of the period, with, for his only orn ---- ent, the red ribbon of the democrats.\n",
      "the authority he wielded did not depend upon braid or buttons, and only when going into battle did he wear h ----  sword.\n",
      "in appearance he  ----  slightly built, rather below the medium height, smooth shaven, and with deep-set gray eyes.\n",
      "these eyes apparently, as they gave him his nickn ---- e, were his most marked feature.\n",
      "his followers called him, and later, when he  ----  thirty-two years old, he was known all over the united states as the \"gray-eyed man of destiny.\"\n",
      "from the first walker recognized that in order to establ ---- h himself in nicaragua he must keep in touch with all possible recruits arriving from san francisco and new york, and that to do this he must hold the line of transit from the caribbean sea to the pacific.\n",
      "at this time the sea routes to the gold-fields were three: by sailing vessel around the cape, one over the isthmus of pan ---- a, and one, which was the shortest, across nicaragua.\n",
      "by a charter from the government of nicaragua, the right to transport passengers across this isthmus  ----  controlled by the accessory transit company, of which the first cornelius vanderbilt was president.\n",
      "his company owned a line of ocean ste ---- ers both on the pacific side and on the atlantic side.\n",
      "passengers _en route_ from new york to the gold-fields were landed by these latter ste ---- ers at greytown on the west coast of nicaragua, and sent by boats of light draught up the san juan river to lake nicaragua.\n",
      "there they were met by larger lake ste ---- ers and conveyed across the lake to virgin bay.\n",
      "from that point, in carriages and on mule back, they were carried twelve miles overland to the port of san juan del sud on the pacific coast, where they boarded the company's ste ---- ers to san francisco.\n",
      "during the year of walker's occupation the number of passengers crossing nicaragua  ----  an average of about two thousand a month.\n",
      "it  ----  to control this route that immediately after his first defeat walker returned to san juan del sud, and in a smart skirmish defeated the enemy and secured possession of virgin bay, the halting place for the passengers going east or west.\n",
      "in this fight walker was outnumbered five to one, but his losses were only three natives killed and a few  ---- ericans wounded.\n",
      "the legitim ---- ts lost sixty killed and a hundred wounded.\n",
      "this proportion of losses shows how fatally effective  ----  the rifle and revolver fire of the californians.\n",
      "indeed, so wonderful  ----  it that when some years ago i visited the towns and cities captured by the filibusters, i found that the marksmanship of walker's phalanx was still a tradition.\n",
      "indeed, thanks to the filibusters, to-day in any part of central  ---- erica a man from the states, if in trouble, has only to show his gun.\n",
      "after the fight at virgin bay, walker received from california fifty recruits--a very welcome addition to his force, and as he now commanded about one hundred and twenty  ---- ericans, three hundred nicaraguans, under a friendly native, general valle, and two brass cannon, he decided to again attack rivas.\n",
      "rivas is on the lake just above virgin bay; still further up is granada, which  ----  the head-quarters of the legitimists.\n",
      "fearing walker's attack upon rivas, the legitimist troops  ----  hurried south from granada to that city, leaving granada but slightly protected.\n",
      "through intercepted letters walker learned of th ----  and determined to strike at granada.\n",
      "by night, in one of the lake ste ---- ers, he skirted the shore, and just before daybreak, with fires banked and all lights out, drew up to a point near the city.\n",
      "the day previous the legitim ---- ts had gained a victory, and, as good luck or walker's \"destiny\" would have it, the night before granada had been celebrating the event.\n",
      "much joyous dancing and much drinking of aguardiente had buried the inhabitants in a drugged slum ---- r.\n",
      "the garr ---- on slept, the sentries slept, the city slept.\n",
      "but when the convent bells called for early mass, the air was shaken with sharp reports that to the ears of the legitimists were unf ---- iliar and disquieting.\n",
      "they  ----  not the loud explosions of their own muskets nor of the smooth bores of the democrats.\n",
      "the sounds  ----  sharp and cruel like the crack of a whip.\n",
      "the sentries flying from their posts d ---- closed the terrifying truth.\n",
      "following them at a gallop c ---- e walker and valle and behind them the men of the awful phalanx, whom already the natives had learned to fear: the bearded giants in red flannel shirts who at rivas on foot had charged the artillery with revolvers, who at virgin bay when wounded had drawn from their boots glittering bowie knives and hurled them like arrows, who at all times shot with the accuracy of the hawk falling upon a squawking hen.\n",
      "there  ----  a brief terrified stand in the plaza, and then a complete rout.\n",
      "as  ----  their custom, the native democrats began at once to loot the city.\n",
      "but walker put his sword into the first one of these he met, and ordered the  ---- ericans to arrest all others found stealing, and to return the goods already stolen.\n",
      "over a hundred political prisoners in the cartel  ----  released by walker, and the ball and chain to which each was fastened stricken off.\n",
      "more than two-thirds of them at once enl ---- ted under walker's banner.\n",
      "he now  ----  in a position to dictate to the enemy his own terms of peace, but a fatal blunder on the part of parker h. french, a lieutenant of walker's, postponed peace for several weeks, and led to unfortunate reprisals.\n",
      "french had made an unauthorized and unsuccessful assault on san carlos at the eastern end of the lake, and the legitimists retaliated at virgin bay by killing half a dozen peaceful passengers, and at san carlos by firing at a transit ste ---- er.\n",
      "for this the excuse of the legitimists was, that now that walker was using the lake ste ---- ers as transports it was impossible for them to know whether the boats were occupied by his men or neutral passengers.\n",
      "as he could not reach the guilty ones, walker held responsible for their acts their secretary of state, who at the taking of granada was  ---- ong the prisoners.\n",
      "he  ----  tried by court-martial and shot, \"a victim of the new interpretation of the principles of constitutional government.\"\n",
      "while this act of walker's  ----  certainly stretching the theory of responsibility to the breaking point, its immediate effect was to bring about a hasty surrender and a meeting between the generals of the two political parties.\n",
      "thus, four months after walker and his fifty-seven followers landed in nicaragua, a suspension of hostilities was arranged, and the side for which the  ---- ericans had fought was in power.\n",
      "walker  ----  made commander-in-chief of an army of twelve hundred men with salary of six thousand dollars a year.\n",
      "a man n ---- ed rivas was appointed temporary president.\n",
      "to walker this pause in the fight  ----  most welcome.\n",
      "it gave him an opportunity to enlist recruits and to organize his men for the better accomplishment of what  ----  the real object of his going to nicaragua.\n",
      "he now had under him a remarkable force, one of the most effective known to military h ---- tory.\n",
      "for although six months had not yet passed, the organization he now commanded was as unlike the phalanx of the fifty-eight adventurers who  ----  driven back at rivas, as were falstaff's followers from the regiment of picked men commanded by colonel roosevelt.\n",
      "instead of the undisciplined and lawless now being in the majority, the ranks were filled with the pick of the california mining c ---- ps, with veterans of the mexican war, with young southerners of birth and spirit, and with soldiers of fortune from all of the great armies of europe.\n",
      "in the civil war, which so soon followed, and later in the service of the khedive of egypt,  ----  several of walker's officers, and for years after his death there was no war in which one of the men trained by him in the jungles of nicaragua did not distinguish himself.\n",
      "in h ----  memoirs, the englishman, general charles frederic henningsen, writes that though he had taken part in some of the greatest battles of the civil war he would pit a thousand men of walker's command against any five thousand confederate or union soldiers.\n",
      "and general henningsen  ----  one who spoke with authority.\n",
      " ---- fore he joined walker he had served in spain under don carlos, in hungary under kossuth, and in bulgaria.\n",
      "all military science failed on a suddenly given field before such assailants, who c ---- e at a run to close with their revolvers and who thought little of charging a gun battery, pistol in hand.\"\n",
      "another graduate of walker's army  ----  captain fred townsend ward, a native of salem, mass., who after the death of walker organized and led the ever victorious army that put down the tai-ping rebellion, and performed the many feats of martial glory for which chinese gordon received the credit.\n",
      "in shanghai, to the memory of the filibuster, there  ----  to-day two temples in his honor.\n",
      "joaquin miller, the poet, miner, and soldier, who but recently was a picturesque figure on the hotel porch at saratoga springs, was one of the young californians who was \"out with walker,\" and who later in his career by his verse helped to preserve the n ---- e of his beloved commander.\n",
      "i. c. j ---- ison, living to-day in guthrie, oklahoma, was a captain under walker.\n",
      "when war again c ---- e, as it did within four months, these were the men who made walker president of nicaragua.\n",
      "during the four months in all but title he had been president, and as such he was recognized and fe ---- d.\n",
      "it was against him, not rivas, that in february, 1856, the neighboring republic of costa rica decl ---- d war.\n",
      "for three months this war continued with varying fortunes until the costa ricans  ----  driven across the border.\n",
      "in june of the s ---- e year rivas called a general election for president, announcing himself as the candidate of the democrats.\n",
      "the legitim ---- ts, recognizing in their former enemy the real ruler of the country, nominated walker.\n",
      "by an overwhelming majority he  ----  elected, receiving 15,835 votes to 867 cast for rivas.\n",
      "salazar received 2,087; ferrer, 4,447. walker now  ----  the legal as well as the actual ruler of the country, and at no time in its history, as during walker's administration, was nicaragua governed so justly, so wisely, and so well.\n",
      "but in h ----  success the neighboring republics saw a menace to their own independence.\n",
      "to the four other republics of central  ---- erica the five-pointed blood-red star on the flag of the filibusters bore a sinister motto: \"five or none.\"\n",
      "the meaning  ----  only too unpleasantly obvious.\n",
      "at once, costa rica on the south, and guatemala, salvador, and honduras from the north, with the malcontents of nicaragua, decl ---- d war against the foreign invader.\n",
      "again walker  ----  in the field with opposed to him 21,000 of the allies.\n",
      "the strength of h ----  own force varied.\n",
      "on his election as president the backbone of his army  ----  a magnificently trained body of veterans to the number of 2,000. this was later increased to 3,500, but it is doubtful if at any one time it ever exceeded that number.\n",
      "his muster and hospital rolls show that during his entire occupation of nicaragua there  ----  enlisted, at one time or another, under his banner 10,000 men.\n",
      "while in h ----  service, of this number, by hostile shots or fever, 5,000 died.\n",
      "to descri ----  the battles with the allies would be interminable and wearying.\n",
      "in every particular they  ----  much alike: the long silent night march, the rush at daybreak, the fight to gain strategic positions either of the barracks, or of the cathedral in the plaza, the hand-to-hand fighting from behind barricades and adobe walls.\n",
      "the out-come of these fights sometimes varied, but the final result was never in doubt, and had no outside influences intervened, in time each republic in central  ---- erica would have come under the five-pointed star.\n",
      "in costa rica there  ----  a marble statue showing that republic represented as a young woman with her foot upon the neck of walker.\n",
      "some night a truth-loving  ---- erican will place a can of dynamite at the foot of that statue, and walk hurriedly away.\n",
      "unaided, neither costa rica nor any other central  ---- erican republic could have driven walker from her soil.\n",
      "his downfall c ---- e through his own people, and through an act of his which provoked them.\n",
      "when walker  ----  elected president he found that the accessory transit company had not lived up to the terms of its concession with the nicaraguan government.\n",
      "h ----  efforts to hold it to the terms of its concession led to his overthrow.\n",
      "of the net profits; but the company, whose history the united states minister, squire, characterized as \"an inf ---- ous career of deception and fraud,\" manipulated its books in such a fashion as to show that there never were any profits.\n",
      "doubting th ---- , walker sent a commission to new york to investigate.\n",
      "the comm ---- sion discovered the fraud and demanded in back payments two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\n",
      "when the company refused to pay this, as security for the debt walker seized its ste ---- ers, wharves, and storehouses, revoked its charter, and gave a new charter to two of its directors, morgan and garrison, who, in san francisco, were working against vanderbilt.\n",
      "in doing this, while he  ----  legally in the right, he committed a fatal error.\n",
      "he had made a powerful enemy of vanderbilt, and he had shut off h ----  only lines of communication with the united states.\n",
      "for, enraged at the presumption of the filibuster president, vanderbilt withdrew his ocean ste ---- ers, thus leaving walker without men or ammunition, and as isolated as though upon a deserted island.\n",
      "he possessed vanderbilt's boats upon the san juan river and nicaragua lake, but they  ----  of use to him only locally.\n",
      "his position  ----  that of a man holding the centre span of a bridge of which every span on either side of him has been destroyed.\n",
      "vanderbilt did not rest at withdrawing his ste ---- ers, but by supporting the costa ricans with money and men, carried the war into central america.\n",
      "from  ---- hington he fought walker through secretary of state marcy, who proved a willing tool.\n",
      "spencer and webster, and the other soldiers of fortune employed by vanderbilt, closed the route on the carib ---- an side, and the man-of-war _st.\n",
      "marys_, commanded by captain davis,  ----  ordered to san juan on the pacific side.\n",
      "the instructions given to captain davis  ----  to aid the allies in forcing walker out of nicaragua.\n",

      "dav ----  claims that he acted only in the interest of humanity to save walker in spite of himself.\n",
      "in any event, the result was the s ---- e.\n",
      "walker, his force cut down by hostile shot and fever and desertion, took refuge in rivas, where he  ----  besieged by the allied armies.\n",

      "there  ----  no salt.\n",
      "the hospital  ----  filled with wounded and those stricken with fever.\n",
      "captain davis, in the n ---- e of humanity, demanded walker's surrender to the united states.\n",
      "walker told him he would not surrender, but that if the time c ---- e when he found he must fly, he would do so in his own little schooner of war, the _granada_, which constituted his entire navy, and in her, as a free man, take his forces where he pleased.\n",
      "then davis informed walker that the force walker had sent to recapture the greytown route had been defeated by the janizaries of vanderbilt; that the ste ---- ers from san francisco, on which walker now counted to bring him re-enforcements, had also been taken off the line, and finally that it was his \"unalterable and deliberate intention\" to seize the _granada_.\n",
      "on th ----  point his orders left him no choice.\n",
      "the _granada_  ----  the last means of transportation still left to walker.\n",
      "but with h ----  ship taken from him and no longer able to sustain the siege of the allies, he surrendered to the forces of the united states.\n",
      "in the agreement drawn up by him and davis, walker provided for the c ---- , by davis, of the sick and wounded, for the protection after his departure of the natives who had fought with him, and for the transportation of himself and officers to the united states.\n",
      "on his arrival in new york he received a welcome such as later  ----  extended to kossuth, and, in our own day, to admiral dewey.\n",
      "the city was decorated with flags and arches; and banquets, fetes, and public meetings  ----  everywhere held in his honor.\n",
      "walker received these demonstrations modestly, and on every public occasion announced his determination to return to the country of which he  ----  the president, and from which by force he had been driven.\n",
      "at  ---- hington, where he went to present his claims, he received scant encouragement.\n",
      "his protest against captain davis  ----  referred to congress, where it was allowed to die.\n",
      "within a month walker organized an expedition with which to regain his rights in nicaragua, and as, in his new constitution for that country, he had annulled the old law abolishing slavery,  ---- ong the slave-holders of the south he found enough money and recruits to enable him to at once leave the united states.\n",
      "with one hundred and fifty men he sailed from new orleans and landed at san del norte on the carib ---- an side.\n",
      "while he formed a c ---- p on the harbor of san juan, one of his officers, with fifty men, proceeded up the river and, capturing the town of castillo viejo and four of the transit steamers, was in a fair way to obtain possession of the entire route.\n",
      "at this moment upon the scene arrived the united states frigate _wabash_ and hir ----  paulding, who landed a force of three hundred and fifty blue-jackets with howitzers, and turned the guns of his frigate upon the camp of the president of nicaragua.\n",
      "captain engel, who presented the terms of surrender to walker, said to him: \"general, i  ----  sorry to see you here.\n",
      "a man like you  ----  worthy to command better men.\"\n",
      "to which walker replied grimly: \"if i had a third the num ---- r you have brought against me, i would show you which of us two commands the better men.\"\n",

      "the jews had fought hard for independence, but if they must  ----  conquered and held in subjection, they preferred the rule of egypt to that of babylon.\n",
      "even the long slavery of their ancestors in that country and the sufferings it had entailed, with the tragic memories of the exodus and the wanderings in the desert, had not been potent to blot out the traditions of the years passed in that pleasant land with its delicious climate, its nour ---- hing and abundant food.\n",
      "alike in prosperity and in evil days the hearts of the people of israel yearned after egypt, and the denunciations of her prophets  ----  never so bitter as when uttered against those who turned from jehovah to worship the false gods of the nile.\n",
      "three times did the inhabitants of jerusalem rebel against the rule of babylon, and three times did nebuchadnezzar come down upon them with a cruel and unrelenting vengeance, carrying off their people into bondage, each time inflicting great d ---- age upon the city and leaving her less capable of resistance; yet each time her rulers had turned to egypt in the vain hope of finding in her a defence against the oppressor, but in every instance egypt had proved a broken reed.\n",
      "of the three successive kings of judah whom nebuchadnezzar had left to rule the city as h ----  servants, and who had all in turn rebelled against him, one had been condemned to perpetual imprisonment in babylon; a second had been carried there in chains and probably killed, while the third, captured in a vain attempt to escape after the taking of the city, had first been made to see his sons killed before his eyes, had then been cruelly blinded, and afterward carried in chains to babylon, and cast into prison.\n",
      "the last siege of the city lasted eighteen months, and when it  ----  finally taken by assault, its ruin was complete.\n",
      "by previous deportations jerusalem had  ----  deprived of her princes, her warriors, her craftsmen, and her smiths, with all the treasure laid up in the palace of her kings, and all the vessels of gold and silver consecrated to the worship of jehovah.\n",
      "little then was left for her to suffer, when the punishment of her latest rebellion c ---- e.\n",
      "her walls  ----  thrown down, her temple, her chief glory, was destroyed, the greater part of the inhabitants who had survived the prolonged siege were carried off to swell the crowd of exiles already in babylon, and only a few of the humbler sort of folk, the vine-dressers and the small farmers, were left behind.\n",
      "when nebuchadnezzar rested after h ----  conquests, secure in the subjugation of his rivals, and in the possession of his vast kingdom, he gave himself up to the material improvement of babylon and the surrounding country.\n",
      "the city as he left it, at the end of his reign of forty-three years, was built on both sides of the euphrates, and covered a space of four hundred squ ----  miles, equal to five times the size of london.\n",
      "it  ----  surrounded by a triple wall of brick; the innermost, over three hundred feet high, and eighty-five feet broad at the top, with room for four chariots to drive abreast.\n",
      "the walls were pierced by one hundred gate-ways fr ---- ed in brass and with brazen gates, and at the points where the euphrates entered and left the city the walls also turned and followed the course of the river, thus dividing the city into two fortified parts.\n",
      "these two districts  ----  connected by a bridge of stone piers, guarded by portcullises, and ferries also plied between the quays that lined the river-banks, to which access was given by gates in the walls.\n",
      "nebuchadnezzar's palace  ----  a splendid structure covering a large space at one end of the bridge.\n",
      "in the central court  ----  the hanging gardens, the chief glory of the city, and reckoned one of the wonders of the world.\n",
      "no clear idea can be formed of these gardens from any description that has come down to us, but it would appear that arches eighty feet high supported terraces of earth planted with all the skill for which the gardeners of the east were f ---- ous.\n",
      "we are told that they were built for the pleasure of queen  ---- uhia, who, as a median princess, missed her native mountains, but a more commonplace explanation is that they were carried so high to escape the mosquitoes that swarmed on the lower level.\n",
      "various splendid edifices, chiefly religious, adorned the great squ ---- s of the city: the temple of the god bel, enriched by the spoils of tyre and jerusalem, was the especial pride of nebuchadnezzar.\n",
      "still another temple of bel was built in seven stages, each faced with en ---- elled brick of one of the planetary colors; the topmost one of blue, the color dedicated to mercury or nebo, the patron god of nabopolassar.\n",
      "but the most important of the civic undertakings of nebuchadnezzar was the extension of the great system of canalization by which the barren wastes of the babylonian plain  ----  made to rival the valley of the nile in fertility, and become the granary of the east.\n",
      "the whole territory  ----  covered with a network of canals fed by the tigris and euphrates, and used for both irrigation and navigation.\n",
      "one branch had already connected nineveh with babylon, and another constructed by nebuchadnezzar united babylon to the persian gulf, running a d ---- tance of four hundred miles.\n",
      "th ----  is still to be traced in a portion of its length.\n",
      "the fate of nebuchadnezzar is one of the most tragic in the long list of cal ---- ities that have overtaken the great and powerful of the earth.\n",
      "according to daniel, it  ----  just after the king had spoken those words of exulting pride as he walked in the palace of the kingdom of babylon: \"is not this great babylon that i have built,\" when he was attacked by that dreadful form of madness, called by the greeks, lycanthropy (wolf-man), in which the victim fancies himself a beast: in its fiercer manifestations a beast of the forest, or in milder visitations a beast of the field.\n",
      "nebuchadnezzar's madness bec ---- e so violent that for four years he was exiled from his throne and from the company of men, and wandered in the fields, eating grass like oxen, \"and his body was wet with the dews of heaven, and his hairs were grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.\"\n",
      "although no mention  ----  made of this strange malady in any writing but the book of daniel, yet it has a pathetic confirmation in one of the rock-cut inscriptions that record the acts of nebuchadnezzar's reign.\n",
      "in the worship of bel-merodach, my lord, the joy of my heart, in babylon the city of his worship and the seat of my empire, i did not sing his praise, nor did i furnish his altar with victims\"--and then, as if returning to the thing that lay ne ---- st him--\"in four years i did not dig out the canals.\"\n",
      "[illustration: \"and he  ----  driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen.\"]\n",

      "in spite of his enemies daniel was allowed to exercise his own religion in peace; and the persecutors of his companions, shadrach, meshach, and abednego, were themselves destroyed in the furnace they had heated for their innocent victims, which the youths themselves were rescued from by the personal interposition of the king, who pretended to see--or in his religious exaltation did really see--the god himself standing guard over the victims in the midst of the fl ---- es.\n",

      "the exchange was accomplished, and after some days the servants of harpagus, sent to inquire if their master's commands had been obeyed, were shown by the herdsman the body of a dead child exposed on the rocks and still wearing the rich clothes and orn ---- ents in which it had been brought to his house.\n",

      "angry at th ----  treatment, he complained to his father, who, indignant in his turn, went to astyages, and reproached him with the blows his son had received at the hands of the son of one of the king's slaves.\n",
      "cyrus was brought before the king; but when he was asked how he had dared to treat the son of a nobleman in such a way, the boy, nothing daunted, answered that he had done only what was right: the rules of the g ---- e were known to all who had joined in it: the other boys had submitted to the penalties: the son of the nobleman alone had refused, and he had been punished as he deserved.\n",

      "but now, as cyrus in our story has grown to man's estate, and is ready to show the world of what stuff he is made, it will be well to explain in a few words, what  ----  the state of things in that part of the world where he was to play his part.\n",

      "media was ruled by astyages, his grandfather--to accept the legendary history as it has come down to us; babylonia the greatest of the three was governed by nebuchadnezzar, while lydia was ruled by croesus, a monarch wise above his peers, whose n ---- e has long been a synonym for unbounded wealth, and whose story, though not beyond the bounds of credibility, reads more like a fable of romance than a tale of sober fact.\n",
      "croesus  ----  the brother-in-law of astyages, and in close alliance not only with the medes, but with the babylonians, the egyptians, and the greeks; and he was at the height of his power and was looking forward to still greater increase of his dominions, when in an evil hour he struck against the growing greatness of cyrus, and was crushed in the encounter.\n",

      "he did not take open measures until he knew he had allies enough at h ----  back, and could strike with a sure aim.\n",
      "he worked with the great median chiefs in private, stirring them up against astyages by appeals of all sorts: to their  ---- bition, their greed, their discontent, their private wrongs; and when he had secured the consent of enough nobles to his plans, he called upon cyrus, as one who had chiefly suffered from the tyranny and cruelty of the king, to lead the proposed revolt in person.\n",
      "he knew that cyrus had been gradually strengthening his own kingdom of persia in preparation for the  ---- bitious schemes of conquest he was nursing, but there was danger in correspondence with one who stood to astyages in the double relation of a feared and hated grandson, and the chief of a rival people; and if we may believe herodotus, harpagus had recourse to a strange expedient to communicate his design to cyrus.\n",
      "disembowelling a dead h ---- , he inserted a letter in the cavity, and sent the animal to cyrus as a present.\n",
      "when the letter c ---- e to the hands of cyrus he eagerly accepted the offers it contained of leadership in the proposed revolt, and joined his forces with those of the disaffected medes.\n",
      "astyages  ----  overthrown and his kingdom taken possession of by cyrus.\n",
      "herodotus draws a striking picture of the exultation of harpagus over the success of his revengeful projects, and of the disdain with which astyages reproached him for having called on another to do what, trusted and confided in as he  ----  by his monarch, he might have accomplished for himself, and reaped the harvest which he had surrendered to another.\n",
      "cyrus had the wisdom to sp ----  the life of astyages, and to attach him to his person as councillor and friend.\n",
      "harpagus he made his lieutenant, and much of his success  ----  owing to this man's wisdom and bravery.\n",
      "after the defeat of astyages, cyrus advanced against the lesser tribes that had owed allegiance to the median king, and having reduced them one by one to subm ---- sion, the power of the once mighty empire of the medians passed to the inheritance of the persians in the year 559 b.c.\n",
      "when croesus heard of the overthrow of his brother-in-law by the hands of cyrus, and of the setting up a great new monarchy on the ruins of the fallen kingdom, his own  ---- bitious projects were blown into fresh activity by the desire for private revenge.\n",
      "misled by his own interpretation of the oracle he consulted as to the likelihood of success in an expedition against the persians, he advanced to withstand the conquering march of cyrus; and his first success  ----  against the syrians of cappadocia, a people subject to cyrus, as having formed a part of the median kingdom.\n",
      "cyrus, with a powerful army, c ---- e at once to the assistance of his new subjects, and meeting the forces of croesus on the plain of cappadocia, a fiercely fought, but indecisive battle took place, which resulted in the retreat of croesus to his capital, sardis, to seek the assistance of his allies and prepare to meet cyrus with a larger force.\n",
      "in overweening confidence in h ----  own success, he dismissed his mercenary troops, and sent messengers to babylon, to egypt, and to sparta, calling on them to come with troops to his assistance within five months.\n",
      "no sooner had he shut himself up in sardis, and dismissed his mercenaries, depending upon his own forces until assistance should come from his allies, than cyrus advanced against him so swiftly that there  ----  no escape from a battle.\n",
      "croesus, believing in his fortune, and trusting to the excellence of his cavalry, boldly took the field; but cyrus, using stratagem where perhaps courage would not have availed, put his c ---- els in front of his line, and massed his own horsemen behind them.\n",
      "the horses of croesus, maddened by the unaccustomed smell of the c ---- els, refused to advance; but the lydians, dismounting, fought so bravely on foot with their spears, that it was not until after a long and fierce combat that they were forced to retreat and seek safety within the walls of sardis.\n",
      "the army of cyrus invested the city, but it was so strongly fortified on all sides but one as to be impregnable by assault and the side left unprotected by art was supposed to be  ---- ply protected by nature, since it abutted on the very edge of a steep precipice.\n",
      "but, after the siege had lasted fourteen days, a persian sentinel saw one of the garr ---- on descend the precipice to recover his helmet that had rolled down; and no sooner had he thus unwittingly showed the way, than the sentinel followed with a number of his fellow-soldiers and, reaching the top of the cliff in safety, attacked the guards, all unsuspicious, and gained an entrance to the city.\n",
      "the gates were opened to the persians, and croesus with all his vast store of treasure bec ---- e the prey of the conqueror.\n",
      "the fall of sardis and the lydian monarchy  ----  followed by the subjection of the greek cities of asia minor, a task which cyrus left to the hands of harpagus, while he himself turned eastward to pursue his conquests in upper asia and in assyria.\n",
      "his greatest achievement in this quarter  ----  the taking of babylon.\n",
      "this he accomplished in the reign of belshazzar, one of the successors of nebuchadnezzar, perhaps his son, by turning the euphrates, which ran through the middle of the city, out of its course; and when its bed  ----  dry he entered the city by this road and captured it with little resistance.\n",
      "cyrus  ----  now the sole master of the vast assyrian kingdom, once more in his hands brought back to something like the unity it had before the great median revolt.\n",
      "but he  ----  not content, nor was it perhaps possible for him to rest in the enjoyment of power and possessions extorted by force, and dependent on force to hold.\n",
      "the new empire, like the old one,  ----  destined to break in pieces by its own weight.\n",
      "cyrus  ----  kept in constant activity by the necessity of resisting the inroads on his empire of the tribes in the north and farther east; and it was in endeavoring to repel invasion and to maintain order in the regions he had already conquered, that he met his death.\n",

      "his aim was to destroy the common oppressor by raising the italian allies against her; and the hope was partly justified by the revolt of lucania and bruttium, s ---- nium and apulia.\n",
      "the soundness of judgment, the patience and self-control which he evinced in this hour of intoxicating success,  ----  hardly less marvellous than the genius by which the success had been won.\n",

      "when he again took the field the romans wisely avoided a pitched battle, though the carthaginians overran italy, capturing locri, thurii, metapontum, t ---- ntum, and other towns.\n",
      "he marched on rome, rode up to the colline gate, and, it  ----  said, flung his spear over the walls.\n",
      "but the fall of capua smote the italian allies with d ---- may, and ruined his hopes of recruiting his ever-diminishing forces from their ranks.\n",
      "he overc ---- e the prætor fulvius at herdonea, and in the following year gained two battles in apulia.\n",

      "in the s ---- e year he met scipio at zama; his raw levies fled, and in part went over to the enemy; his veterans were cut to pieces where they stood, and carthage was at the mercy of rome.\n",
      "so ended the second punic war--the war, as arnold so truly said, of a man with a nation, and the war which  ----  perhaps the most wonderful in all history.\n",
      "three hundred thousand italians had fallen, and three hundred towns had  ----  destroyed in the struggle.\n",
      "peace being made, hannibal turned h ----  genius to political toils.\n",
      "he  ---- ended the constitution, cut down the power of the ignoble oligarchy, checked corruption, and placed the city's finances on a sounder footing.\n",

      "napoleon, the only general who could plausibly challenge the carthaginian's supremacy, had throughout the greater part of his c ---- er an immense superiority to his adversaries in the quality of the forces which he wielded.\n",
      "he had the enthusiasm of the revolution behind him, and he was unh ---- pered by authorities at home.\n",
      "hannibal, on the contrary, saw h ----  plans thwarted and finally wrecked by the sordid merchant-nobles of the city he strove so hard to save.\n",
      "he had to mould h ----  little army out of raw and barbarous levies.\n",

      "here the chief command of the remaining troops  ----  unanimously entrusted to him and another.\n",
      "on this occasion it  ----  owing to his presence of mind that the remnants of the roman army did not, in their despair, quit italy.\n",
      "212, scipio  ----  curule ædile, though he had not yet attained the legitimate age.\n",
      "the tribunes of the people endeavored to prevent his election, but they  ----  obliged to give up their opposition, for the people, who seem to have perceived the extraordinary abilities of the young man, elected him almost unanimously.\n",
      "211 h ----  father and uncle fell in spain, and the carthaginians again took possession of the country, which they had almost entirely lost.\n",
      "on the day of the election, no one ventured to come forward to undertake the command in th ----  war.\n",
      "the people  ----  struck with admiration at the courage of the young man, and gave him command, with proconsular power, which was afterward prolonged to him for several years (b.c.\n",
      "the extraordinary power which young scipio exercised over his contemporaries  ----  perhaps partly owing to superstition, for he was believed to be a favorite of the gods.\n",
      "ever since he had r ---- en to manhood, he went every morning into the capitol, where he spent some hours in solitude and meditation.\n",
      "hence all he did  ----  considered by the people to be the result of his intercourse with the gods.\n",
      "scipio himself partook in th ----  opinion, and cherished it; and the extraordinary success of all his enterprises must have strengthened his belief.\n",
      "210, or, as livy says, at the  ---- ginning of spring, scipio set out for spain with an army of 11,000 men, landed at the mouth of the iberus, and undertook the command of the whole roman forces in spain.\n",
      "he  ----  accompanied by his friend, lælius.\n",
      "his first object  ----  to gain possession of new carthage, where the carthaginians kept their spanish hostages.\n",
      "the town soon fell into the hands of the romans, and the generosity with which scipio treated the span ---- h hostages gained over a great number of spaniards.\n",
      "the hostages of those tribes who decl ---- d themselves allies of the romans were sent home without ransom.\n",
      "it is also related that a very beautiful maiden having fallen to his special lot in the division of the booty, scipio finding her sad, inquired the cause, and learning that she  ----  betrothed to a neighboring chief, sent for the lover, and personally restored the maid in all honor to his arms.\n",
      "a short time after the conquest of th ----  place scipio went to tarraco, where he received embassies from various spanish tribes, who offered to become the allies of the romans or to recognize their supremacy.\n",
      "scipio  ----  said not to have set out against hasdrubal until the year following, but it can scarcely be conceived why the carthaginians should have been so long inactive, and it is a probable supposition that the battle with hasdrubal, which livy and polybius assign to the year b.c.\n",
      "209,  ----  fought very soon after the taking of new carthage.\n",
      "in this battle scipio gained a great victory; 8,000 carthaginians were slain, and 22,000, with their c ---- p, fell into the hands of the victor.\n",
      "many of the spaniards now w ---- hed to proclaim scipio their king, but he refused the honor.\n",
      "hasdrubal fled with the remainder of h ----  army toward the tagus and the pyrenees.\n",
      "scipio did not follow him, partly because he thought his enemy too much weakened to be dangerous, and partly because he fe ---- d lest he might expose himself to the combined attacks of the two other carthaginian generals, mago, and hasdrubal, son of gisco.\n",
      "hasdrubal barcas, the defeated general, however, had carried considerable wealth with him in h ----  flight, and with these means he raised an army in spain, to lead into italy to the assistance of his brother hannibal, hoping thus to bring the war to an end in italy.\n",
      "during these preparations of hasdrubal, scipio  ----  engaged against the two other carthaginian generals, one of whom (mago) was defeated, in b.c.\n",
      "208, by the proprætor silanus, in the country of the celtiberians, and hanno, who c ---- e with an auxiliary army from africa, was taken prisoner.\n",
      "after th ----  success of the proprætor, scipio united his forces with those of silanus to attack hasdrubal, son of gisco.\n",
      "but as th ----  general had retired to the south of spain, and had distributed his army in the fortified places on the bætis as far as gades, scipio (through his brother lucius) only took the important town of oringis, and then gradually returned across the iberus.\n",
      "the power of the carthaginians in spain  ---- , however, already broken, and in the year following (b.c.\n",
      "207) scipio gained possession of nearly all spain by a victory, the place of which  ----  not clearly ascertained, some calling it silpia or bæcula, some ilipa, and others carmo.\n",
      "scipio, now in the almost und ---- puted possession of spain, began to turn his eyes to africa, and, accompanied by his friend lælius, he ventured to pay a visit to king syphax, with whom lælius had already commenced negotiations.\n",
      "here scipio  ----  said to have met hasdrubal, son of gisco, and to have made a very favorable impression on syphax as well as on hasdrubal.\n",
      "after a short stay in africa, scipio returned to spain, where he first pun ---- hed several towns for their faithlessness, and subdued some of the spanish chiefs who ventured to claim their former independence.\n",
      "during these occupations scipio was attacked by a severe illness, from which, however, he recovered in time to quell an insurrection of 8,000 roman soldiers, who were discontented from not having derived from their conquests those advantages which they had expected, and who  ----  said also to have been bribed by the carthaginians.\n",
      "mago had in the meantime withdrawn to the balearic  ---- lands, and thence to liguria.\n",
      "gades, the last place which the carthaginians possessed in spain,  ----  now taken from them, and thus the war in spain was at an end.\n",
      "he evidently w ---- hed for a triumph, but the senate paid no attention to his wishes, for no one had ever triumphed at rome before he had held the consulship.\n",
      "205, scipio was made consul with p. licinius crassus, who was at the s ---- e time pontifex maximus, and was consequently not allowed to leave italy.\n",
      "if, therefore, a war  ----  to be carried on abroad, the command necessarily devolved upon scipio.\n",
      "his wish was immediately to sail with an army to africa, but the more cautious senators, and especially q. fabius, were decidedly opposed to his plan, partly because hannibal, as long as he was in italy, appe ---- d too formidable to be neglected, and partly because they were influenced by jealousy.\n",
      "all that scipio could obtain  ----  that sicily should be assigned to him as his province, with thirty vessels, and with permission to sail over to africa in case he should think it advantageous to the republic.\n",
      "but he did not obtain from the senate perm ---- sion to levy an army, and he therefore called upon the italian allies to provide him with troops and other things necessary for carrying on the war.\n",
      "as they  ----  all willing to support the conqueror of the carthaginians in spain, he was soon enabled to sail to sicily with nearly seven thousand volunteers and thirty ships.\n",
      "soon after his arrival in sicily he sent his friend lælius with a part of his fleet to africa, partly to keep up the connection which he had formed there, on his visit from spain, with syphax and massinissa (for to the latter scipio had sent back a nephew who had been taken prisoner in the battle of bæcula), and partly to show to his timid opponents at rome how groundless their fears  ---- .\n",
      "he himself employed h ----  time in sicily most actively, in preparing and disciplining his new army.\n",
      "massinissa, dissatisfied with the carthaginians,  ----  anxious for the arrival of scipio in africa, but syphax had altered his policy, and again joined the carthaginians.\n",
      "the enemies of scipio at rome at last got an opportunity of attacking him, and they nearly succeeded in depriving him of h ----  post.\n",
      "without being authorized by the senate, scipio had taken part in the conquest of locri, in southern italy, and had left his legate, q. fl ---- inius, as commander of the roman garrison in that place.\n",
      "the legate treated the locrians with such severity and cruelty that they sent an embassy to rome to lay their complaints  ---- fore the senate.\n",
      "as scipio, although acquainted with the conduct of fl ---- inius, had nevertheless left him in command, his enemies attacked him on this and other grounds, and fabius maximus even proposed that he should be recalled.\n",
      "a commission was sent out to inquire into the state of affairs and to bring scipio home, if the charges against him  ----  found true.\n",
      "scipio proved that his army was in the best possible condition; and the commissioners  ----  so surprised at what they saw, that instead of recalling the consul, they bade him sail to africa as soon as he might think it proper, and to adopt any measures that he might think useful.\n",
      "scipio, in consequence of th ---- , sailed in b.c.\n",
      "but scipio could not gain possession of utica, which  ----  of the greater importance to him and his fleet as the winter was approaching, and he was obliged to spend the season on a piece of land extending into the sea, which he fortified as well as he could.\n",
      "toward the close of the winter the carthaginians, united with syphax, intended to make a general attack on scipio's army and fleet, but being informed of their plans, he surprised the c ---- ps of hasdrubal and syphax in the night, and only a small number of the enemy escaped.\n",
      "syphax withdrew into his own dominions, but  ----  defeated by massinissa and lælius, and taken prisoner with his wife and one of his sons.\n",
      "massin ---- sa married sophonisba, the wife of syphax, who had formerly been engaged to him, but had been given to syphax for political reasons.\n",
      "scipio, fearing the influence she might have on massinissa (for she  ----  a carthaginian), claimed her as a prisoner belonging to the romans, and massinissa poisoned her, to save her from the humiliation of captivity.\n",
      "the fears and apprehensions of the carthaginians now increased to such a degree that they thought it necessary to recall hannibal from italy, and at the s ---- e time they sued for peace.\n",
      "the carthaginians, however, whose only object  ----  to gain time, made no objections to the conditions, but only concluded a truce of forty-five days, during which an embassy was to be sent to rome.\n",
      "before this truce was at an end, the carthaginian populace plundered some roman vessels with provisions, which were wrecked off carthage, and even insulted the roman envoys who c ---- e to demand reparation.\n",
      "scipio did not resent this conduct and allowed the carthaginian  ---- bassadors, on their return from rome, to pass on to carthage unmolested.\n",
      "about this time (it  ----  the autumn of the year b.c.\n",
      "203) hannibal arrived in africa, and soon collected an army in num ---- rs far exceeding that of scipio.\n",
      "he first made a successful c ---- paign against massinissa.\n",
      "scipio  ----  at this time informed that the consul tib.\n",
      "scipio, who wished to bring the war to a conclusion, and was unwilling to sh ----  the glory with anyone else, determined to bring hannibal to a decisive battle.\n",
      "the carthaginian at first avoided an engagement; but when scipio, in order to deceive the enemy, hastily retreated as if he intended to take to flight, hannibal followed him with his cavalry and lost a battle in the neighborhood of z ---- a.\n",
      "a tribune of scipio soon afterward cut off a large convoy of provisions which was on its way to the c ---- p of hannibal, and this suddenly threw him into such difficulties that he began to negotiate with scipio for peace.\n",
      "the conditions, however, which scipio now proposed  ----  so humiliating, that the carthaginians would not accept them.\n",
      "hannibal, therefore, though he saw the impossibility of gaining any further advantages,  ----  compelled to decide the affair by a last and desperate effort.\n",
      "in a personal interview between the two generals scipio  ----  inexorable as to the conditions.\n",
      "hannibal's army was in a bad condition; and in the ensuing battle, to the west of z ---- a, the victory of scipio was complete.\n",
      "th ----  defeat (in b.c.\n",
      "202)  ----  the death-blow to carthage.\n",
      "scipio, on his return to italy, was received with the greatest enthusiasm; he entered rome in triumph, and was henceforward distinguished by the n ---- e of africanus.\n",
      "he now for several years continued to live at rome, app ---- ntly without taking any part in public affairs.\n",

      "193, during one of the disputes between the carthaginians and massinissa, scipio  ----  sent with two other commissioners to mediate between the parties; but nothing was settled, though, as livy observes, scipio might easily have put an end to the disputes.\n",
      "scipio  ----  the only roman who thought it unworthy of the republic to support those carthaginians who persecuted hannibal; and there was a tradition that scipio, in b.c.\n",
      "193, was sent on an embassy to antiochus, and that he met hannibal in his exile, who in the conversation which took place, decl ---- d scipio the greatest of all generals.\n",
      "whether the story of the conversation be true or not, the judgment ascribed to hannibal is just; for scipio as a general  ----  second to none but hannibal himself.\n",
      "190, some d ---- cussions arose in the senate as to what provinces should be assigned to the two consuls, lælius and l. cornelius scipio, brother of the great africanus.\n",
      "africanus, although he  ----  princeps senatus, offered to accompany his brother, as legate, if the senate would give him greece as his province, for this province conferred upon lucius the command in the war against antiochus.\n",

      "the king offered to restore him to freedom, and to give a considerable sum of money, if the father would interpose h ----  influence to obtain favorable terms for the king.\n",
      "africanus refused; but the king, notwithstanding, soon after sent the boy back to his father, who just then was suffering from illness, and was absent from the c ---- p.\n",
      "to show his gratitude, africanus sent a message to antiochus, advising him not to engage in a battle until he himself had returned to the roman c ---- p.\n",
      "after the great battle near mount sipylus, antiochus again applied to scipio for peace, and the latter now used h ----  influence with his brother lucius and the council of war, on behalf of the king.\n",
      "the conditions of the peace  ----  tolerably mild, but they were afterward made much more severe when the peace was ratified at rome.\n",
      "the peace with antiochus, and the conditions proposed by africanus and his brother lucius,  ----  regarded by the hostile party as the result of bribes from antiochus, and of the liberation of the son of africanus.\n",
      "a charge  ----  therefore brought against the two brothers, on their return to rome, of having accepted bribes of the king, and of having retained a part of the treasures which they ought to have delivered up to the ærarium.\n",

      "after a little hesitation trajan accepted the position, which  ----  marked by the titles of imperator, cæsar, and germanicus, and by the tribunician authority.\n",
      "the authority of the new emperor  ----  recognized at once all the empire over.\n",
      "the novel fact that a master of the romans should have been born on span ---- h soil seems to have passed with little remark, and this very absence of notice is significant.\n",
      "trajan's first c ----  as emperor was to write to the senate an assurance like that which had been given by nerva, that he would neither kill nor degrade any senator.\n",
      "he ordered the establ ---- hment of a temple and cult in honor of his adoptive father, but he did not present himself at rome for nearly two years after his accession.\n",
      "possibly he had taken measures  ---- fore nerva's death to secure the revenge which nerva craved, but probably did not live to see.\n",
      "in his dealings with the mutinous prætorians the strength of the new emperor's hand  ----  shown at once.\n",
      "they did not venture to disobey, and were distributed  ---- ong the legions there.\n",
      "those who remained at rome  ----  easily overawed and reformed.\n",
      "it is still more surprising that the soldiers should have quietly submitted to a reduction in the  ---- ount of the donative or gift which it was customary for them to receive from a new emperor, though the civil population of the capital were paid their largess (_congiarium_) in full.\n",
      "by politic management trajan  ----  able to represent the diminution as a sort of discount for immediate payment, while the civilians had to wait a considerable time before their full due was handed to them.\n",
      "the secret of trajan's power lay in h ----  close personal relations with the officers and men of the army, and in the soldierly qualities which commanded their esteem.\n",
      "having a good title to military d ---- tinction himself, he could afford, as the unwarlike emperors could not, to be generous to his officers.\n",
      "the common soldiers, on the other hand, were fascinated by his personal prowess and his somewhat ostentatious _c ---- araderie_.\n",
      "his features were firm and clearly cut; his figure was tall and soldierly, and exhibited the sinewy hard health of a veteran c ---- paigner.\n",
      "his hair was already gray before he c ---- e to the throne, though he was not more than forty-four years old.\n",
      "the stoutness of the emperor's arm had been proved in the face of h ----  men in many a hard fight.\n",
      "when on service he used the mean f ----  of the common private, dining on salt pork, cheese, and sour wine.\n",
      "nothing pleased him better than to take part with the centurion, or the soldier in fencing or other military exerc ---- e, and he would applaud any shrewd blow which fell upon his own helmet.\n",
      "he loved to display his acquaintance with the c ---- er of distinguished veterans, and to talk with them of their battles and their wounds.\n",
      "probably he lost nothing of h ----  popularity with the army by occasional free indulgence in sensual pleasures, with which, as bacon remarks, the soldier is apt to pay himself for the perils he encounters.\n",
      "yet every man felt and knew that no detail of military duty, however minute, escaped the emperor's eye, and that any relaxation of d ---- cipline would be rigidly punished, yet with unwavering justice.\n",
      "trajan emphasized at once his personal control and the constitutionality of his sway, by bearing on his c ---- paigns the actual title of \"proconsul,\" which no other emperor had done.\n",
      "all things considered, it is not surprising that he  ----  able, without serious opposition from the army, to remodel the whole military institutions of the empire, and to bring them into a shape from which there was comparatively little departure so long as the army lasted.\n",
      "in d ---- ciplinary matters no emperor since augustus had been able to keep so strong a control over the troops.\n",
      "pliny rightly pra ---- es trajan as the lawgiver and the founder of discipline, and vegetius classes augustus, trajan, and hadrian together as restorers of the _morale_ of the army.\n",
      "the confidence which ex ---- ted between trajan and his army finds expression in some of the coins of his reign.\n",
      "for nearly two years after h ----  election trajan did not appear in rome.\n",
      "he had decided already what the great task of h ----  reign should be--the establishment of security upon the dangerous north-eastern frontier.\n",
      "before v ---- iting the capital he determined to put affairs in train for the attainment of this great object.\n",
      "he made a thorough inspection of the great lines of defence between the danube and the rhine, and fr ---- ed, and partly carried out, a vast scheme for strengthening and securing them.\n",
      "the policy of opposing uncivilized tribes by the construction of the _limes_, a raised embankment of earth or other material, intersected here and there by fortifications,  ----  not his invention, but it owed in great measure its development to him.\n",
      "th ----  grand work, which would have excited the envy of augustus, is traceable in its main extent at the present day.\n",
      " ---- ong a people of roadmakers, trajan was one of the greatest, and we have definite evidence from inscriptions that some of the military roads in this region were constructed by him.\n",
      "the more secure control which the romans now maintained over the territory within the _limes_, tended to its rapid civilization, and the roman influence, if not the roman arms, soon  ---- gan to affect powerfully the regions beyond.\n",
      "after his c ---- ful survey of the rhine end of the great defensive barrier, trajan proceeded to consider it and plan it from the danube.\n",
      "from the age of ti ---- rius onward, the romans possessed the whole southern bank of the river from its source to the euxine.\n",
      "but the precarious tenure of their possession, had been deeply impressed on them by the d ---- asters and humiliations they had undergone in these districts during the reign of domitian.\n",
      "a prince had arisen  ---- ong the dacians, decebalus by name, worthy to be placed at the head of all the great barbarian antagonists of rome.\n",
      "like maroboduus, he  ----  able to combine the forces of tribes commonly hostile to each other, and his military ability almost went the length of genius.\n",
      "after he had swept the province of moesia b ---- , he was defeated by one of domitian's lieutenants, but the position of affairs on the danubio-rhenish border was still so threatening, that the emperor was glad to conclude a treaty which conferred extraordinary advantages on his foe.\n",
      "during the nine or ten years which had elapsed since the conclusion of th ----  remarkable treaty, the dacian prince had immensely strengthened the approaches to his kingdom from the roman side.\n",
      "he had also equipped and drilled h ----  formidable army after the roman fashion.\n",
      "it  ----  impossible for a soldier like trajan to endure the conditions laid down by domitian; but the conquest of dacia had become one of the most formidable tasks that had ever confronted the empire.\n",
      "trajan, no doubt, planned a war before he left the danube for rome late in 99. the arrival of the emperor had been awaited in the capital with an impatience which  ----  expressed by pliny and by martial.\n",
      "all that had happened since trajan's elevation to the throne had ra ---- ed high at rome the hope of a prosperous and glorious reign.\n",
      "as he entered the city and went on foot to the capitol, the plaudits of the people  ----  unmistakably genuine.\n",
      "during h ----  stay in the city he riveted more firmly still the affections both of the senate and of the people.\n",
      "the reconciliation of the empire with li ---- rty, inaugurated, as tacitus says, by nerva, seemed now to be securely achieved.\n",
      "trajan  ----  absolutely open and simple, and lived with men at rome as he had lived with his soldiers while on service.\n",
      "the assurance that no senator should suffer  ----  renewed by oath.\n",
      "all the old republican formalities  ----  most punctiliously observed--even those attendant on the emperor's election to the consulate, so far as they did not involve a restoration of the old order of voting at the comitia.\n",
      "the veneration for republican tradition  ----  curiously attested by the reproduction of many republican types of coin struck by senatorial officers.\n",
      "trajan seized every opportunity for emphasizing his view that the _princeps_  ----  merely the greatest of the magistrates, and so was not above but under the laws.\n",
      "he  ----  determined, he said, to be to his subjects such a ruler as he had desired for himself when a subject.\n",
      "there  ----  a pretty story to the effect that he handed the commander of the prætorians his sword, and said, \"use it for me if i do well, but against me if i do ill.\" martial, who had called domitian his lord and his god, now cried, \"in him we have no lord, but an imperator!\"\n",
      "real power and influence  ----  accorded to the senate, which had now, by the incorporation of members whose origin was provincial, become in a manner representative of the whole empire.\n",
      "all pomp  ----  distasteful to him, and discarded by him.\n",
      "there was practically no court, and no intrigues of any kind  ----  possible.\n",
      "the approach to his house  ----  free, and he loved to pass through the city unattended, and to pay unexpected visits to his friends.\n",
      "there  ----  but one insignificant conspiracy against him during his whole reign.\n",
      "h ----  intimate, m. licinius, played an excellent mæcenas to his augustus.\n",
      "in his efforts to win the affections of roman society, trajan was excellently aided by his wife plotina, who was as simple as her husband, benevolent, pure in character, and entirely un ---- bitious.\n",
      "the hold which trajan acquired over the people  ----  no less firm than that which he maintained upon the army and the senate.\n",
      "his largesses, his distributions of food, his public works, and his spectacles  ----  all on a generous scale.\n",
      "the exhibitions in the  ---- na were perhaps at their zenith during his tenure of power.\n",
      "though, for some unexplained reason, he abol ---- hed the mimes, so beloved of the populace, at the outset of his reign, he availed himself of the occasion of his first triumph to restore them again.\n",
      "the people  ----  delighted by the removal of the imperial _exedra_ in the circus, whereby five thousand additional places were provided.\n",
      "taxation  ----  in many directions reduced, and the financial exactions of the imperial officers controlled by the erection of a special court.\n",
      "elaborate precautions were taken to save italy from f ---- ine; it is said that corn for seven years' consumption at the capital was retained in the granaries.\n",
      "special encouragement  ----  given to merchants to import articles of food.\n",
      "the corporation of bakers  ----  organized, and made more effective for the service of the public.\n",
      "the internal trade of italy was powerfully stimulated by the c ---- ful maintenance and extension of the different lines of road.\n",
      "but the most striking evidence of trajan's solicitude for his people's welf ----  is found in his institution of the _alimenta_, whereby means were provided for the rearing of poor and orphan children in italy.\n",
      "the method had been sketched out by nerva, but its great development  ----  due to trajan.\n",
      "the moneys allotted by the emperor  ----  in many cases supplemented by private benevolence.\n",
      "as a soldier, trajan realized the need of men for the maintenance of the empire against the outer barbarians, and he preferred that these men should  ----  of italian birth.\n",
      "he  ----  only carrying a step further the policy of augustus, who by a system of rewards and penalties had tried to encourage marriage and the nurture of children.\n",
      "the annual effect of trajan's regulations is hard to measure; they  ----  probably more effectual for their object than those of augustus.\n",
      "the foundations  ----  confiscated by pertinax, after they had existed less than a century.\n",
      "toward the end of 100, or early in 101, trajan left rome for the danu ---- .\n",
      "pretexts for a dacian war  ----  not difficult to find.\n",
      "although there  ----  no lack of hard fighting, victory in this war depended largely on the work of the engineer.\n",
      "the great military road connecting the posts in upper germany with those on the danube, which had been begun by tiberius,  ----  now extended along the right bank of the river as far as the modern orsova.\n",
      "the year 101  ----  spent mainly in roadmaking and fortification.\n",
      "in the following c ---- paign, after desperate fighting to the north of the danube in the mountainous region of transylvania, such as cæsar never encountered in all his gaulish wars, the capital of decebalus was taken, and he was forced to terms.\n",
      "he agreed to raze all fortresses, to surrender all weapons, pr ---- oners, and roman deserters, and to become a dependent prince under the suzerainty of rome.\n",
      "trajan c ---- e back to italy with dacian envoys, who in ancient style begged the senate to confirm the conditions granted by the commander in the field.\n",
      "the emperor now enjoyed h ----  first dacian triumph, and assumed the title of dacicus.\n",
      "at the s ---- e time he royally entertained the people, and no less royally rewarded his brave officers.\n",
      "but the dacian chief could not school his high spirit to endure the conditions of the treaty, and trajan soon found it necessary to prep ----  for another war.\n",

      "he, or rather maximianus by his order, caused the magnificent thermæ at rome to be built, the remains of which still bear diocletian's n ---- e, and which contained, besides the baths, a library, a museum, public walks, and other establishments.\n",

      "various causes have been assigned for th ----  measure.\n",
      "it  ----  known that galerius had always been hostile to the christians, while diocletian had openly favored them, had employed them in his armies and about his person; and eusebius speaks of the prosperity, security, and protection which the christians enjoyed under his reign.\n",
      "just before the edict  ----  issued, galerius had repaired to nicomedia to induce diocletian to proscribe the christians.\n",
      "the imperial palace took fire, constantine (\"oratio ad coetum sanctorum\") says, from lightning, and galerius suggested to the emperor that it  ----  a christian plot.\n",
      "the heathen priests on their part exerted themselves for the s ---- e purpose.\n",
      "it happened that on the occasion of a solemn sacrifice in presence of the emperor, while priests were consulting the entrails of the victims, the christian officers in the imperial retinue crossed themselves; upon which the priests decl ---- d that the presence of profane men prevented them from discovering the auspices.\n",
      "diocletian, who was very anxious to pry into futurity, bec ---- e irritated, and ordered all his christian officers to sacrifice to the gods under pain of flagellation and dismissal, which many of them underwent.\n",
      "several oracles which he consulted gave answers unfavorable to the chr ---- tians.\n",
      "the church of nicomedia  ----  the first pulled down by order of the emperor.\n",
      "the rashness of a christian who publicly tore down the imperial edict exasperated diocletian still more: the culprit  ----  put to a cruel death.\n",
      "then c ---- e a second edict, ordering all magistrates to arrest the christian bishops and presbyters, and compel them to sacrifice to the gods.\n",
      "this was giving to their enemies power over their lives, and it proved, in fact, the beginning of a cruel persecution, whose ravages  ----  the more extensive in proportion to the great diffusion of christianity during a long period of toleration.\n",
      "this was the last persecution under the roman empire, and it has been called by the n ---- e of diocletian.\n",
      "but that emperor  ---- sued the two edicts reluctantly and after long hesitation, according to lactantius's acknowledgment: he fell ill a few months after, and on recovering from his long illness he abdicated.\n",
      "galerius, who had instigated the persecution,  ----  the most zealous minister of it; the persecution raged with most fury in the provinces subject to his rule, and he continued it for several years after diocletian's abdication, so that it might with more propriety be called the galerian persecution.\n",
      "legend says that he died of a horrible d ---- ease, filled with remorse and imagining himself haunted by the martyred spirits.\n",
      "in november of that year (303) diocletian repaired to rome, where he and maximianus enjoyed the honor of a triumph, followed by festive g ---- es.\n",
      "this  ----  the last triumph that rome saw.\n",
      "the populace of that city complained of the economy of diocletian on the occasion, who replied that moderation and temperance  ----  most required when the censor was present.\n",
      "they vented their d ---- pleasure in jibes and sarcasms, which so hurt diocletian that he left rome abruptly in the month of december for ravenna, in very cold weather.\n",
      "in this journey he  ----  seized by an illness which affected him the whole of the following year, which he spent at nicomedia.\n",
      "at one time he  ----  reported to be dead.\n",
      "galerius soon after c ---- e to nicomedia, and it is said that he persuaded diocletian to abdicate.\n",
      "on the 1st of may he repaired with h ----  guards to a spot three miles out of nicomedia, where he had thirteen years before proclaimed galerius as cæsar, and there addressing his officers and court, he said that the infirmities of age warned him to retire from power, and to deliver the administration of the state into stronger hands.\n",
      "constantine, who has given an account of the ceremony, which is quoted by eusebius in his life of that prince, was present, and the troops fully expected that he would be the new cæsar; when they heard another mentioned, they asked each other whether constantine had changed his n ---- e.\n",
      "but galerius did not leave them long in suspense; he pushed forward maximinus and showed him to the assembly, and diocletian clothed him with the purple vest, after which the old emperor returned privately in his carriage to nicomedia, and immediately after set off for salona in dalmatia, near which he built himself an extensive palace by the sea-shore, in which he lived for the rest of his life, respected by the other emperors, without c ---- s and without regret.\n",
      "part of the external walls which inclosed the area belonging to his palace and other buildings still remain, with three of the gates, as well as a temple, which is now a church at spalatro, or spalato, in dalmatia, a comparatively modern town, grown out of the decay of the ancient salona, and built in great part within the walls of diocletian's residence, from the n ---- e of which, \"palatium,\" it is believed that \"spalato\" is derived.\n",
      "at the s ---- e time that diocletian abdicated at nicomedia, maximianus, according to an agreement between them, performed a similar ceremony at milan, proclaiming constantius as augustus, and severus as cæsar.\n",
      "both severus and maximinus daza  ----  inferior persons, and creatures of galerius, who insisted upon their nomination in preference to that of maxentius and constantine, whom diocletian had at first proposed.\n",
      "maximianus retired to his seat in lucania, but not being endowed with the firmness of diocletian he tried some time after to recover his former power, and wrote to his old colleague to induce him to do the s ---- e.\n",
      "\" ----  you but to come to salona,\" answered diocletian, \"and see the vegetables which i grow in my garden with my own hands, you would no longer talk to me of empire.\"\n",
      "in h ----  retirement he used to observe to his associates how difficult it is, even for the best-intentioned man, to govern well, as he cannot see everything with his own eyes, but must trust to others, who often deceive him.\n",
      "once only he left h ----  retirement to meet galerius in pannonia for the purpose of appointing a new cæsar, licinius, in the place of severus, who had died.\n",
      "licinius, however, did not prove grateful, for after the death of galerius, in 311, he ill-treated h ----  widow, valeria, diocletian's daughter, who then, with her mother, prisca, took refuge in the territories of maximinus daza.\n",
      "diocletian remonstrated in favor of his wife and daughter, but to no purpose, and his grief on this occasion probably hastened his death, which took place at his residence near salona in july, 313. in the following year his wife and daughter  ----  put to death by order of licinius.\n",
      "diocletian ranks  ---- ong the most distinguished emperors of rome; his reign of twenty-one years was upon the whole prosperous for the empire, and creditable to the roman name.\n",

      "the chr ---- tian writers, and especially lactantius, have spoken unfavorably of him; but lactantius cannot be implicitly trusted.\n",
      "of the regular historians of his reign we have only the meagre narratives of eutropius and aurelius victor, the others being now lost; but notices of diocletian's life are scattered about in various authors, libanius, vopiscus, eusebius, julian in his \"cæsars,\" and the contemporary panegyrists, eumenes and m ---- ertinus.\n",

      "as usual, the native inhabitants  ----  his friends, but were in terror of the gothic garrison, and these, on their side, were afraid of treating with the greek general because theodatus had their wives and children as hostages.\n",
      "theodatus, however, shut himself up in rome and gave no aid to naples, and belisarius had made up his mind to raise the siege and attack rome itself, when one of his soldiers c ---- e to tell him that in exploring an aqueduct which had been stopped, he had found that the passage for the water could easily be enlarged so as to admit armed men.\n",

      "there  ----  a real conspiracy, and the enemies of the general accused him of sharing in it.\n",

      "his mother  ----  bertha, daughter of charibert, count of leon.\n",
      "of his boyhood we know as little as of his birth, but he seems at an early age to have mingled in the real business of life, for when only twelve years old we find him despatched to receive and welcome the sovereign pontiff who c ---- e to implore his father's aid against the barbarians that threatened rome.\n",
      "from the usual habits of the franks, it is also probable that he accompanied pepin in his c ---- paigns at an early age; but the first time that we really see him in the field, is on the renewal of the war with the rebellious duke of aquitaine.\n",
      "upon the death of pepin, 768, charlemagne and h ----  younger brother, carloman, succeeded to equal portions of one of the most powerful european kingdoms, bounded by the pyrenees, the alps, the mediterranean, and the ocean.\n",
      "but this would hardly have enabled the monarchs, even had they been united, to resist successfully the incursions of the barbarous tribes on the german frontiers of france, which had commenced with the first establishment of the frankish dominion in gaul; and which  ----  kept alive by the constant pouring out of fresh hordes from the overpopulated north.\n",
      "the situation of charlemagne  ----  rendered yet more perilous by the passive enmity of his brother, and the rebellion of hunald, the turbulent duke of aquitaine.\n",
      "but fortunately, charlemagne had a genius equal to the difficulties of h ----  situation; though his brother refused to aid him, he defeated hunald; and no less illustrious by his clemency than by his valor and military skill, he forgave the vanquished rebel.\n",
      "desiderius, the king of lombardy, had made large encroachments upon the states of the roman pontiff, whose cause  ----  taken up by charlemagne.\n",
      "th ----  led to feuds, which bertha, the mother of the frankish king, endeavored to appease by bringing about a union between her son and the daughter of the lombard.\n",

      "gilberga, the widow of carloman, immediately fled, and sought an asylum with desiderius, the common place of refuge for all who  ----  hostile to the frankish monarch.\n",

      "such a day, however, might come; a second attila might ar ---- e; and with a full conviction of these perils, charlemagne, when he marched against the barbarians, determined to put them down effectually.\n",
      "he took and destroyed the f ---- ous temple of the irminsule, the great idol of their nation--that is, the hermansaule, or pillar of hermann, which had originally been raised to commemorate the defeat of the roman varus by that hero, though in time the name had got corrupted, and the cause of its erection been forgotten.\n",
      "the saxons  ----  too wise to meet their powerful opponent in the field, and when, as often happened, they were brought to bay, they made a feigned submission, and obtained mercy by vows they never meant to keep.\n",
      "meanwhile events had been taking place in another quarter, that called away charlemagne, and obliged him to leave h ----  generals to watch over them.\n",
      "the lombard king, desiderius, had made use of h ----  absence to plunder the papal see, to which adrian had now succeeded.\n",
      "with some difficulty the pope contrived to give his friend notice of his danger, when charlemagne assembled a vast army, one division of which he himself led into italy over the alps by mount cenis, while the other was conducted to the s ---- e ground by his uncle, duke bernard, over the mons jovis, or mount joux, which from this event received the name it has borne ever since, of the great saint bernard.\n",
      "although surpr ---- ed by an invasion from a quarter so unexpected, desiderius marched out to meet his enemy, but his flank being turned, he fled hastily to pavia, without having struck a blow; charlemagne pursued the fugitives, but finding the city too strong to be taken by storm, he blockaded it with one portion of his army, while with the other he proceeded against verona, having reduced which, he returned to the siege of pavia.\n",
      "month after month passed, till at length easter approached, when, leaving the city blockaded as before, he determined to v ---- it rome in his capacity of patrician or governor.\n",
      "his march through the italian towns was one of uninterrupted triumph; everywhere he was met with accl ---- ations, and at rome he was received by the pope, as well as the people, with the liveliest expressions of gratitude for having freed them from the tyranny of the lombards.\n",
      "the friendship then cemented between adrian and h ----  young deliverer lasted through the remainder of their lives without any serious interruption.\n",
      "having thus asserted his rights of patrician or exarch, charlemagne was liberal in his donations to the church, and soon afterward returned to the siege of pavia, which it now bec ---- e important for him to bring to a speedy conclusion, the saxons having again taken advantage of his absence to ravage his frontiers.\n",
      "about the middle of the year, the city surrendered, and he  ----  crowned with the iron crown of lombardy.\n",
      "he then marched against the saxons, defeating them whenever they ventured to make a stand, till they found their best resource  ----  in submission.\n",
      "it was not long before a fresh revolt  ---- ongst the lombards recalled him to their country.\n",
      "once more he was victorious and once more he was summoned from his c ---- er of conquest to meet the saxons.\n",

      " ---- id all these fatigues and battles, which might appear sufficient to have occupied the attention of any one man, charlemagne retained in his own hands the general government of the state.\n",
      "the local administration was distributed  ---- ong twelve provincial officers, with the title of dukes, each of them having the command of a county.\n",
      "subordinate to these officers  ----  the counts, who, in fact, were the judges of the land, and had full authority to decide and punish within their jurisdiction.\n",
      "to secure the faithful performance of their duties by these dukes and counts, certain officers, under the n ---- e of missi dominici, were sent in visitations from time to time to inquire into their conduct.\n",
      "in great ecclesiastical questions, or those affecting the more powerful vassals of the crown, either the king himself, or the count of h ----  palace, sat as judge.\n",

      "that country had been subdued by the arabs, but the descendants of the first conquerors quarrelled  ---- ong themselves, and ibn al arabi, a powerful chief, sought aid of charlemagne, who marched thither, and being, as usual, victorious, secured to himself a barrier against the saracens and gascons.\n",
      "this was seen with ill-will by lupo, duke of gascony, who when the frankish king was leaving spain to meet fresh dangers on the rhine, treacherously laid an  ---- bush for his destruction in the gorges of the pyrenees.\n",
      "the monarch himself  ----  allowed to pass with the first division of his army, the second was assailed and destroyed in the valley of roncesvalles, and the conquerors secreting themselves in their mountain fastnesses, presented no object for the vengeance of the indignant monarch.\n",

      "their cruelty, however,  ----  retaliated by their almost total annihilation while attempting to retreat across the adern, and in the ensuing season charlemagne reduced them, as it seemed, to a state of total submission.\n",

      "in snorro the story is involved in miracle, rumor, and fable; but the fact itself seems certain, and is very interesting; the great, wild, noble soul of fierce olaf opening to this wonderful gospel of tidings from beyond the world, tidings which infinitely transcended all else he had ever heard or dre ---- t of!\n",
      "it seems certain he  ----  baptized here; date not fixable; shortly before poor heart-broken dunstan's death, or shortly after; most english churches, monasteries especially, lying burnt, under continual visitation of the danes.\n",

      "in the south ---- pton country he came in contact with the then bishop of winchester, afterward archbishop of canterbury, excellent elphegus, still dimly decipherable to us as a man of great natural discernment, piety, and inborn veracity; a hero-soul, probably of real brotherhood with olaf's own.\n",

      "daily and hourly vigilant to do so, often enough by soft and even merry methods,--for he  ----  a witty, jocund man, and had a fine ringing laugh in him, and clear pregnant words ever ready,--or if soft methods would not serve, then by hard, and even hardest, he put down a great deal of miscellaneous anarchy in norway; was especially busy against heathenism (devil-worship and its rites): this, indeed, may be called the focus and heart of all his royal endeavor in norway, and of all the troubles he now had with his people there.\n",

      "instead of which he rushed into the temple with his armed men; smashed down, with his own battle-axe, the god thor prostrate on the floor at one stroke, to set an ex ---- ple; and in a few minutes had the whole hakon pantheon wrecked; packing up, meanwhile, all the gold and preciosities accumulated there (not forgetting thor's illustrious gold collar, of which we shall hear again), and victoriously took the plunder home with him for his own royal uses and behoof of the state.\n",

      "in spite of which, however, there went from tryggveson, who was now a widower, some incipient marriage proposals to this proud widow; by whom they  ----  favorably received; as from the brightest man in all the world, they might seem worth being.\n",

      "the licentiousness of some of their number, moreover, proved fatal to their vigilance, and a sudden sortie of the garr ---- on inflicted deadly havoc.\n",
      "the siege was then commenced in earnest; but the city was so strongly guarded, that months elapsed without any impression being made upon its walls; and disease, f ---- ine, and the inclemency of the season, united with the missiles of the turks to weaken the christian force.\n",

      "a timely supply of provisions from some of the armenian monasteries, and a brilliant victory obtained by bohemond and the count of toulouse over an army which the sultans of aleppo and d ---- ascus had sent to the succor of antioch, rewarded godfrey's confidence and infused new vigor into the hearts of his army.\n",

      "notwithstanding all these exploits, the turks held out, and  ----  only defeated at last by stratagem.\n",
      "this  ----  achieved by the skill of bohemond, who intrigued with phirous, one of the leaders of the garrison, for the surrender of the city, upon favorable terms to himself.\n",
      "bohemond stipulated with his fellow-chiefs that the principality of antioch should be granted him in return for his services; and, after some opposition, this  ----  conceded.\n",

      "the crusaders had no sooner obtained this signal success than they  ----  in their turn besieged by an army raised by the sultans of mossoul and other cities.\n",

      "the barons and knights proceeded chiefly on foot, and c ---- els and asses supplied the place of horses to most of those who rode.\n",
      "yet the burning zeal of the chr ---- tians made the march seem like a triumphal procession; and while the clergy sang hymns of consolation and victory, the soldiers responded with the war-cry, \"it is god's will!\n",

      "the turkish general, fearing nothing from an army so scantily provided with the means of war,  ----  taken by surprise, but hastily arranged his troops in order of battle.\n",
      "the sight of several natural prodigies, such as the sudden appearance of a meteor, and the favorable direction of the wind, acting upon the superstitious fancy of the chr ---- tians, impelled them to extraordinary exertions.\n",
      "the moslem forces, on the other hand,  ----  weakened by the existence of rivalries and discords in their midst, and lacked the stimulus which the christians derived from desperation.\n",
      "the attack  ----  commenced by a volley of arrows, followed by a charge of the turkish and arabian archers, which the crusaders not only steadily sustained, but vigorously returned.\n",
      "godfrey, who commanded their right wing, broke the left wing of the moslem; but the latter had encompassed the river with a large force, and attacked the chr ---- tians in the rear.\n",
      "in spite of the heroism of godfrey and tancred, who slaughtered all that ventured to compete with them, and the brave resistance of the whole army, the enemy was evidently gaining ground, when (according to the historians) three horsemen, in brilliant armor, suddenly appe ---- d at the head of a reinforcement descending from the adjacent mountains.\n",
      "some of the clergy seized on th ----  circumstance to reanimate the crusaders.\n",

      "the crusaders, instead of proceeding at once to jerusalem, remained for several months in antioch, employing the time in re-establ ---- hing christianity in that city, and sending to their brethren in the west for further aid.\n",
      "the delay was prejudicial, as the disputes between the rival chiefs, which the din of war had silenced, again broke out, and disease committed terrible ravages in the c ---- p.\n",
      "certain expeditions, however,  ----  made in the neighborhood, and several towns fell into the hands of the christians.\n",

      "embassadors  ----  sent from the caliph of cairo with superb presents to the christian leaders, and proposals of peace between them and the egyptians.\n",
      "but godfrey would not be bribed to accept the humiliating terms proposed; one of which  ---- , that only unarmed christians should be admitted into the city.\n",
      "the embassadors  ----  sent back with the answer that the crusaders were on their march, and, if opposed, might extend their conquests even to the nile.\n",

      "some fell on their knees and prayed; others k ---- sed the sacred soil; many wept for their sins; and the air ever and anon resounded with the shout: \"it is god's will!\"\n",

      "the egyptians had prepared for a protracted defence, by strengthening the fortifications and furnishing the garrison with  ---- ple provisions.\n",

      "owing to these impediments the chr ---- tians made slow progress.\n",
      "after various disappointments, however, they at length manufactured engines of great size and strength, shaped like towers, which  ----  to be wheeled up to the walls, so as to enable the besiegers to enter by means of drawbridges.\n",

      "godfrey's tower was first pushed close beside the walls, and in spite of fl ---- e and missile the drawbridge was lowered.\n",
      "then, accompanied by several of h ----  bravest knights, he dashed into the city.\n",
      "others followed at the s ---- e point; the gates were broken down, and jerusalem was taken.\n",

      "of france, to join the last of the crusades, but when he reached tun ---- , found that king dead, and the expedition already desperate of success.\n",
      "he went on to acre, and won great renown as a knight, but failed to save the frank ---- h kingdom in the east from its inevitable fate.\n",
      "in june, 1272, while sitting alone on his bed, his own strength and energy saved him from being murdered by one of the inf ---- ous sect of the assassins.\n",
      "hastily guarding himself with h ----  arms, and receiving a desperate wound, from which he afterward suffered much, he tore the knife from his assailant's hand, and buried it in his heart.\n",
      "the ancient story that h ----  queen eleanor, who had followed him in his pilgrimage, saved his life at the risk of her own by sucking the poison from the wound, unfortunately lacks historical support, but fits well with the romantic temper of the times, as well as with the deep affection that survived throughout life betwixt husband and wife.\n",
      "two months later he started for home, and at capua, in the january of 1273, heard of h ----  father's death two months before.\n",
      "meantime he had been quietly proclaimed king, and as things went well in england, he v ---- ited the pope, did homage at paris for his french provinces, and did not return to his kingdom till the august of 1274. at his coronation he received the homage of alexander iii.\n",
      "of scotland for h ----  lands in england, but prince llewelyn of wales neglected the summons to attend, and only did his homage in 1276, under the combined terrors of excommunication and the royal army.\n",
      "edward at once commenced that w ---- e and large policy of domestic consolidation and financial as well as legal reform, that has shed such lustre upon the reign of the english justinian, as he has been called, and made it almost the most important epoch in the constitutional history of england.\n",
      "his first warf ----  was with the turbulent and disaffected welshmen, who had profited by the intestine turmoil of the preceding reign, and intrigued perpetually with the rebellious nobles of henry iii.\n",
      "the forced peace of 1277, and the national dissatisfaction at the stringent terms granted by edward, which was not abated by the personal favors he heaped upon the princes llewelyn and his brother david, were but the preludes to the final struggle which commenced three years later, and ended in the complete suppression of welsh nationalism, with the defeat and death of llewelyn, near builth, in brecknockshire, and the cruel execution of david at shrewsbury, as a traitor, in 1284. by the f ---- ous statute of wales in the same year, the ancient principality was finally annexed to the english crown, while english laws and english institutions were forced upon the conquered people.\n",
      "edward devoted the next year to leg ---- lation, then went abroad to mediate, without success, in the quarrel between france and aragon.\n",
      "he had soon to return to quell fresh d ---- turbances in wales, and even in england, where the great statute of winchester, which had been passed in 1285 to place the defence of the country on a really national basis, had not yet had time to effect its end.\n",
      "finding that most of h ----  judges had been corrupting justice, he punished them with an iron hand, next banished in 1290 all the jews to the number of over sixteen thousand from the kingdom, on the plea of extortionate usury.\n",
      "just at th ----  time the death of the young scottish queen, the maid of norway, whom edward had caused to be betrothed to his eldest surviving son, edward of caernarvon, opened up a fatal contest for the scottish crown, which gave edward his opportunity to assert anew the old but somewhat shadowy claim of the english crown to the over-lordship of scotland.\n",
      "the southern half of that composite kingdom  ----  inhabited by people of english blood and english institutions; its southeastern part, the lothians, had undoubtedly once formed part of the anglian kingdom of northumbria; while its southwestern, strathclyde or scottish cumbria, the population of which was in great part celtic, had in 945 been given by the english king edmund i. to malcolm as a fief.\n",
      "the northern portion of the kingdom was purely celtic in blood, and had at no time been subject to english influences, but though the reigning f ---- ily was itself of celtic origin, its authority hardly extended effectively beyond the region inhabited by men of english blood.\n",
      "undoubtedly the scottish king in 921 chose edward the elder \"to father and to lord,\" and the right then acknowledged was claimed successively by willi ----  the conqueror, rufus, and other english kings.\n",
      "moreover, from the twelfth century it had been customary for the scottish kings or their sons to receive english earldoms, and do homage for them, but it continued to remain somewhat vague whether such homage  ----  understood to be extended beyond these earldoms, so as to include the lowland provinces and the whole scottish kingdom.\n",
      "willi ----  the lion, taken prisoner at alnwick in 1174, for his freedom acknowledged the supremacy of henry ii.\n",
      "in the treaty concluded at felaise on december 7; but on his return found his subjects ill-disposed to accede to his cowardly submission; and fifteen years later the claim founded on this special act of submission  ----  formally renounced for a sum of 10,000 merks by richard i., who was eager to raise money for his crusade.\n",
      "such  ----  the ill-defined position of this ancient controversy, when fate seemed to fling into edward's hands the opportunity of defining it anew with all the clearness dear to his legal mind.\n",
      "it was easy for him to secure a recognition of his superiority from the selfish and eager candidates for the crown, and meantime he secured the scottish castles, and after a deliberate ex ---- ination of the rival claims, decided in favor of john baliol, who, on his accession, paid homage distinctly for the whole kingdom of scotland.\n",
      "he soon found h ----  position as a vassal-king intolerable, betwixt the unruly turbulence of his subjects and the imperious demands of his overlord, who allowed appeals to be led from baliol's subjects to himself.\n",
      "meantime the  ---- bitious projects of the new king of france, philip iv., involved edward in anxieties for the safety of guienne and his other possessions in france.\n",
      "ere long the high-handed conduct of the french king made war necessary, and edward, with characteristic energy, at once began his preparations, and summoned in 1295 an assembly of the estates of the realm, which was practically the beginning of the modern parli ---- ents.\n",
      "the ever-increasing exasperation of the scots at length broke out into open warfare in 1296. edward at once marched northward, captured berwick, and carried his victorious arms as far north as aberdeen, banff, and elgin, taking the great castles on the way, formally accepted baliol's surrender of the crown at montrose, and returned to berwick (august 22), carrying with him the f ---- ous coronation-stone from scone, after having subdued the whole kingdom in about five months.\n",
      "here, six days later, he received the fealty of the clergy, barons, and gentry of scotland, whose n ---- es fill the thirty-five skins of parchment known as the \"ragman roll.\"\n",
      "at length he  ----  at liberty to turn to france, but the great cost of his late expenditure had already driven him to make such heavy demands upon the revenues of the church, that the clergy now refused fresh subsidies, headed by archbishop winchelsea and supported by the bull \"clericis laicos\" of pope boniface viii.\n",
      "at the salisbury parli ---- ent in february, 1297, the great barons also refused to take part in foreign war, while the merchants were exasperated because their wool had been seized.\n",
      "a compromise was soon effected with the clergy, and a temporary illegal grant for the immediate purposes of the war was procured from the nobles and commons who  ----  with him.\n",
      "edward sailed for flanders, and at ghent confirmed the charter with such supplementary clauses as  ----  demanded by his refractory nobles, thus finally establishing the right of the people themselves to determine taxation.\n",
      "th ----  is only second in importance to magna charta itself as a landmark in the history of england.\n",
      "the suspicious fears of his people compelled edward to repeat the confirmation at london in 1300, and again at lincoln in 1301--an insult to his honesty which the king never forgave, and to which his subsequent banishment of winchelsea  ----  due.\n",
      "in 1303, and again the year after, edward, in desperate straits for money, levied, by agreement with the foreign merchants, some new customs--the beginning of import duties, without consent of the estates, and collected a _tallage_ from the royal demesne; and again, in 1305, he obtained from clement v. a formal absolution from the obligations of 1297. it is true that the first two measures  ----  contrary to the spirit rather than the letter of his promise, and that he never sought to avail himself of the dangerous power granted him by the papal absolution, yet these three facts, says bishop stubbs, \"remain on record as illustrations of edward's chief weakness, the legal captiousness, which was the one drawback on his greatness.\"\n",
      "it  ----  the dangerous aspect of affairs in scotland that forced the king to submit so easily to the demands of his barons.\n",
      "already, in the spring of 1297, wallace, without any countenance from the scottish nobility, had commenced a guerilla warfare, and his handful of desperate men soon increased into an army, which completely defeated earl warenne and cressingh ----  at cambuskenneth (stirling bridge), in september, 1297, and ravaged england, with the most atrocious cruelties, from newcastle to carlisle.\n",
      "edward's expedition to flanders had been a failure, but he hastened to conclude a truce, so as to find time to chastise the scots, cementing it by his betrothal to philip's sister marg ---- t.\n",
      "the good queen eleanor had  ----  already dead nine years.\n",
      "meantime, wallace's success had merely earned him the bitter jealousy of the scottish nobles, and his power  ----  finally broken in the disastrous defeat by edward's army at falkirk in july, 1298. the king had two of his ribs broken by a kick from his horse on the morning of the battle, but rode throughout the day as if unhurt.\n",
      "the struggle lingered on some years under various leaders, as edward found h ----  energy paralyzed the while by the intrigues of philip, and the constitutional struggle with his barons.\n",
      "pope boniface, in 1301, put forth a claim to the over-lordship of scotland, which  ----  repudiated by the whole body of the estates at lincoln.\n",
      "it  ----  not till the june of 1303 that the king was able to resume his conquest.\n",
      "accompanied by a fleet carrying h ----  supplies, he penetrated again into the far north, tarried a while in dunfermline, and settled the kingdom after the reduction of stirling, the last place of strength that held out.\n",
      "in 1305 wallace  ----  betrayed into his hands, sent to london, and cruelly executed as a traitor.\n",
      "the fate of this noble-hearted patriot is a fatal blot upon his conqueror's memory, but it should not be forgotten that edward  ----  profoundly convinced of the legality of his own claims over scotland, and that wallace to him was merely a pestilent rebel, who had earned his doom by treason to his lord and by the cruelties he had inflicted upon englishmen.\n",
      "the s ---- e year the king prepared a new constitution for the conquered kingdom, divided it into sheriffdoms like the english counties, and made arrangements for the representation of the scots in the english parliament--a measure which, had it been successful, might have anticipated by four centuries the benefits of the union.\n",
      "it might now have been expected that scotland was effectively subdued, but ere long robert bruce, who had hitherto played a dubious g ---- e, raised a revolt in the beginning of 1306, got rid of the regent comyn, his most serious rival, by a foul murder in dumfries church, was crowned king at scone, and kept up an incessant but varying struggle during the winter of 1306 and the spring of 1307. the treachery of those who had sworn fealty to him, and whom he had trusted implicitly, roused edward to the pitch of exasperation, and at the knighting of prince edward at westminster, he swore a solemn vow to be revenged upon bruce.\n",
      "he at once despatched a force to scotland, and though now old and infirm, began preparations for his fourth expedition; but he  ----  attacked with dysentery on the march, and his malady increased so much upon him that he died on the 7th of july, 1307, at burgh-on-sands, near carlisle, within sight of scotland, leaving for his son edward the dying command not to bury his body till he had utterly subdued the scots, but to carry his bones with the army until the victory was complete.\n",
      "eleven days later the young prince reached carl ---- le, but returned a few weeks after to london, and buried his father's body in westminster, where it still rests under a slab, with the simple but truly descriptive inscription: \"eduardus primus, scotorum malleus, hic est.\"\n",

      "during his minority the government of the kingdom was intrusted to a body of guardians with henry of lancaster at their head, but was virtually usurped by roger mortimer, until the king, irritated by his arrogance, caused him to be seized at nottingh ----  on october 15, 1330, and conveyed to the tower.\n",

      "nor were his wars undertaken without cause, or indeed, according to the ideas of the time, without  ---- ple justification.\n",
      "his attempts to bring scotland under his power were at first merely a continuation of an inherited policy that it would have been held sh ---- eful to repudiate, and later were forced upon him by the alliance between that country and france.\n",

      "no sense of duty beyond what  ----  then held to become a knight influenced his conduct.\n",
      "although the early glories of his reign  ----  greeted with applause, he never won the love of his people; they groaned under the effects of his extravagance, and fled at his coming lest his officers should seize their goods.\n",
      "his commercial policy  ----  enlightened, and has won him the title of the \"father of english commerce\" but it was mainly inspired by selfish motives, and he never scrupled to sacrifice the interests of the english merchants, to obtain a supply of money or secure an ally.\n",
      "in foreign politics he showed genius; his alliances  ----  well devised and skilfully obtained, but he seems to have expected more from his allies than they were likely to do for him, for england still stood so far apart from continental affairs, that her alliance was not of much practical importance, except commercially.\n",
      "as a leader in war edward could order a battle and inspire his army with his own confidence, but he could not plan a c ---- paign; he was rash, and left too much to chance.\n",
      "during the first part of his reign he paid much attention to naval administration; he successfully asserted the maritime supremacy of the country, and was entitled by parli ---- ent the \"king of the sea;\" he neglected the navy in his later years.\n",
      "little as the nation owed him in other respects, his achievements by sea and land made the english n ---- e respected.\n",
      "it is said to have been chiefly through mortimer's influence that, on april 24, 1328, a peace was concluded between england and scotland, the chief provisions of which  ----  that the scots agreed to pay the sum of £20,000, and that edward agreed to recognize the independence of the scotch crown.\n",
      "the treaty  ----  very unpopular in england, and it is not surprising, therefore, that, when edward baliol in 1332 made his attempt to mount the scotch throne, edward iii.\n",
      "gave him indirect assistance, and that after baliol's dethronement in 1333 an invasion of scotland  ----  resolved on.\n",
      "his army  ----  in great danger, and was hemmed in by the sea, the tweed, the garrison of berwick, and the scottish host, which far outnumbered the english.\n",
      "on the 20th he drew up h ----  men in four battles, placing his archers on the wings of each; all fought on foot, and he himself in the van.\n",
      "the engl ---- h archers began the fight; the scots fell in great numbers, and others fled, the rest charged up the hill and engaged the enemy hand to hand.\n",
      "they  ----  defeated with tremendous loss; many nobles were slain, and it was commonly said in england that the war was over, for that there was not a scot left to raise a force or lead it to battle.\n",
      "edward ordered a general thanksgiving for th ----  victory.\n",
      "receiving as the result of h ----  victory the submission of the principal scotch nobles, he annexed the whole of scotland south of the forth to his own crown, and allowed baliol to reign over the remainder as titular king.\n",
      "soon after, baliol  ----  again a fugitive, but was again aided by edward to mount a nominal throne.\n",
      "after a short period of peace edward, in july, 1336, ravaged and burned scotland as far as aberdeen, but growing complications with france compelled him in the s ---- e year to return to england.\n",
      "though he professed to have a claim, through his mother, on the french throne against philip of valois, that claim  ----  left in abeyance until several acts of aggression on the part of philip brought about a rupture between the two kings.\n",
      "the count of flanders, at philip's instigation, had broken off commercial relations with england; french privateers were daily committing ravages on english commerce; aquitaine was continually threatened by desultory attacks; and philip, though he hesitated to accept the responsibility of being the first to decl ----  war, scarcely attempted to conceal his endeavors to throw that responsibility on edward.\n",
      "edward sailed for flanders july 16, 1338, and at coblentz held a conference with the emperor lou ----  v., at which the latter appointed him his vicar-general, and gave orders for all the princes of the low countries to follow him in war for the space of seven years.\n",
      "in 1339 edward laid siege to c ---- brai, but soon afterward raised the siege and invaded france.\n",
      "philip advanced to meet him, but declined battle, and edward concluded his first c ---- paign without achieving anything to compensate him for its cost.\n",

      "he was remarkable for ugliness, and was an object of aversion to his p ---- nts.\n",
      "he first made himself a n ---- e as a soldier at the tournament held at rennes in 1338 to celebrate the marriage of charles of blois with jeanne de penthièvere, at which he unseated the most famous competitors.\n",
      "but this playing at fighting was not enough for his  ---- bition; and in the war which followed between charles of blois and john de montfort, for the possession of the duchy of brittany, he served his apprenticeship as a soldier.\n",
      "as he  ----  not a great baron with a body of vassals at his command, he put himself at the head of a band of adventurers, and fought on the side of charles and of france.\n",

      "in 1351, having shortly before been made a knight, he  ----  sent into england with the lords of brittany to treat for the ransom of charles of blois, who had been defeated and captured by the english in 1347. when rennes was besieged by the duke of lancaster, in 1356, du guesclin forced his way with a handful of men into the town, and successfully defended it till june, 1357, when the siege was raised in pursuance of the truce of bordeaux.\n",

      "[tn]] henry, the fifth english monarch of that n ---- e, was born at monmouth, on the banks of the pleasant wye, in the year 1388. he was the eldest son of henry, earl of derby, and of mary de bohun, daughter of the earl of hereford.\n",
      "during his infancy reverses and successes passed rapidly over his father's head, and at the age of thirteen years he found himself the eldest son of the king of england, and  ----  created by his father prince of wales, duke of cornwall, and earl of chester.\n",
      "the early education of henry the fifth is unknown; but it may be inferred, that during the life of his mother, principles of high honor and virtue had been instilled into his bosom, which bec ---- e dormant, though not extinct, as rising toward manhood, evil companions took advantage of idleness and indulgence to call into action the passions of the young prince, in order to lead him to their own purposes.\n",
      "the tales of his debauchery, and the depravity of his taste, while a youth, have been doubted and contradicted, but not disproved by modern historians; but the positive assertions of older writers, whose means of information  ----  great and immediate, must always be more valuable than the theoretical doubts of persons who live when a thousand sources of knowledge have been buried under the lumber of ages.\n",
      "it is therefore more than probable that, in his youth, henry the fifth gave himself up to low companions, unworthy a prince and a gentleman, and yielded to his passions indulgences which  ----  forbidden by his reason.\n",
      "nevertheless, through the whole course of his youthful errors, as portrayed by those least favorable in their account, there is to be seen the gle ---- ing forth of those better principles, that nobler soul, which rendered him in after years one of the greatest and best of english monarchs.\n",
      "out of a multitude of events which might be brought forward to prove th ----  fact, one of the best authenticated, and the most striking, is his submission to chief-justice gascoigne.\n",
      "henry, it would appear, had entered the court of justice in support of one of his dissolute companions, who had rendered himself  ---- enable to the laws of his country.\n",
      "notwithstanding the presence and influence of the prince, the mag ---- trate did his duty toward the offender, without fear or favor, and in the heat of the moment, henry struck the judge upon the judgment-seat.\n",
      "time had been given for the better spirit to assume her influence, and struck with the conscientious courage of the judge, the heir-apparent of the british throne submitted to the punishment he had merited, and suffered himself without opposition to be led to prison, thus setting a noble ex ---- ple of obedience to the laws.\n",
      "his father was of a mind well qualified to appreciate the conduct both of his son and of his son's judge, and when the news was brought him--probably by those who sought to infl ---- e the monarch's mind against the punisher of his son--he exclaimed, with joy: \"blessed is the king whose magistrates possess courage to execute the laws upon such an offender; and still more happy is he who has for a son a prince willing to endure such wholesome chastisement.\"\n",
      "although from all accounts it would appear that many parts of the prince's conduct gave great pain and offence to h ----  father, yet we find that henry iv.\n",
      "never scrupled to entrust to his c ----  some of the greatest and most important military operations of his reign.\n",
      "whether the prince had already displayed the qualities of a soldier, in a degree sufficient to attract the notice of his father, or whether the king sought only to habituate him early to that inevitable c ---- er of arms which was in those days one of the misfortunes of royalty, we are not informed; but so early as his sixteenth or seventeenth year he fought at the battle of shrewsbury, in which henry hotspur was slain.\n",
      "what  ----  the part assigned to the prince on this occasion i do not find stated precisely; but all accounts agree that he proved of infinite assistance and service to his father, and fought long in the thickest of the battle, after having been severely wounded by an arrow in the face.\n",
      "the death of percy spread dismay  ---- ong his soldiers and allies, and after a fight of nearly four hours the party of northumberland fled, leaving the king master of the field of battle, and a number of noble prisoners.\n",
      "many of these  ----  executed either at shrewsbury or london; and the earl of northumberland, the chief support of the rebellion, made his peace for the time to meditate his rebellions.\n",
      "owen glendower, however, one of the confederates,  ----  still in arms in wales; and while henry iv.\n",
      "returned in triumph to london, he despatched h ----  eldest son, at the head of considerable forces, to reduce the principality to obedience.\n",
      "the unhappy glendower, unable to oppose the army led against him, was forced to fly, and, abandoned by his friends and followers, is said to have died of starvation  ---- ong the caves and wildernesses in which he sought refuge.\n",
      "in the meanwhile the prince of wales conducted h ----  expedition with skill and wisdom; the whole country submitted to his power; and having re-established order and tranquillity, he returned to london with honor and praise.\n",
      "little further occurs in the h ---- tory of henry as prince of wales which is interesting in itself, if stripped of the embellishments added to it by the fancy of our great poet.\n",
      "a project of marriage between the heir of the british crown and a daughter of the duke of burgundy,  ----  entertained for some time, but died away, and the opposite, or orleans party in france, was afterward supported by the english crown.\n",
      "at length henry the fourth, on the eve of an expedition to the holy land, undertaken, it is said, in expiation of his usurpation of the throne, was struck with apoplexy; and a tale, in regard to his death, is current  ---- ong the historians of the period, on which shakespeare has founded one of the most beautiful scenes in his historical dramas.\n",
      "the poet, however,  ----  far more indebted for the splendor of his materials to his own imagination, than any historical record.\n",
      "the facts, as related by the best authorities,  ----  simply as follows.\n",
      "after the first attack of apoplexy the king was carried to a ch ---- ber in the house of the abbot of westminster, and put to bed, and at his own desire the crown was laid upon his pillow.\n",
      "he languished in a state of great weakness for some time, and at length, after a second attack, appe ---- d to those who were watching him to have yielded the spirit.\n",
      "the ch ---- berlain immediately spread a linen cloth over the face of the king, and hastened to communicate his supposed death to the heir-apparent, who, entering the room to take a last look at his father's body, removed the crown from his pillow, and carried it into another apartment.\n",
      "after a short time the monarch revived, and sending for h ----  son demanded, angrily, why he had removed the crown.\n",
      "the prince replied that all men had thought him dead, and therefore he had taken the symbol of royalty as h ----  by right.\n",
      "\"of that,\" replied the prince, \"it  ----  not for me to judge; but if you die king, my father, i will have the garland, and will defend it with my sword against all enemies as you have done.\"\n",
      "not long after th ----  conversation henry iv.\n",
      "expired, and his son, the prince of wales, was immediately proclaimed king by the title of henry v. but his change was not alone in n ---- e or station; his vices and his follies he cast from him, as an unworthy garment, and assumed with royalty a royal mind.\n",
      "the debauched companions of his youth  ----  banished from his presence and his counsels, and forbidden to approach within ten miles of his dwelling.\n",
      "but at the s ---- e time we are assured that they were not left in indigence or necessity.\n",
      "wisdom and virtue bec ---- e the only recommendations which raised any one to his service, and those who had proved themselves most worthy, under the government of the former monarch, found themselves most readily welcomed by the new king.\n",
      "no sooner was the truce at an end which then existed between france and england, than henry himself proceeded to south ---- pton to take the command of his army in person.\n",
      "the english arm ---- ent put to sea, and notwithstanding great preparations which had been made for defending the french coast, henry landed his troops in safety at the mouth of the seine, and immediately laid siege to harfleur, at that time the principal sea-port of normandy.\n",
      "the dauphin himself advanced to vernon on the seine, and the f ---- ous marshal boucicault, one of the most celebrated knights of his time, gathered together a large force, and advanced toward the english army.\n",
      "nevertheless henry did not suffer his courage to fail, and the siege  ----  continued with unabated vigor.\n",
      "at length the means of defence  ---- gan to fail within the town.\n",
      "two wagons of powder, which the french attempted to introduce, fell into the hands of the english; the walls  ----  ruined by the effects of the artillery, and at length the governor agreed to surrender, if he remained unrelieved at the end of three days.\n",
      "the three days expired without succor, and harfleur  ----  surrendered to the king of england.\n",
      "[here follows a long and glowing account of henry's retreat in the face of the overwhelming french forces, and of his greatest victory, the f ---- ous battle of agincourt.]\n",
      "shortly after his return to england, henry was visited by sigismund, emperor of germany, accompanied by french  ---- bassadors commissioned to treat for peace under his mediation.\n",
      "but while henry continued to exact severe terms, the french gave him constant excuses for proceeding in the war, by their efforts to recover harfleur, which, however,  ----  constantly defeated by the activity of the english monarch and his officers.\n",
      "to conquer the former patrimony of the brit ---- h kings seemed the monarch's first object, and in a very short time he made himself master of almost all the principal cities of the duchy.\n",
      "caen, indeed, resisted with devoted courage, and, after a severe siege,  ----  taken by assault; but the governors of the other fortified places in normandy, divided between the armagnac and the burgundian parties, had no confidence in their soldiers or each other, and one after another submitted to the power of the conqueror.\n",
      "nor, indeed, did henry sp ----  any means to obtain his purpose in such a bloodless manner.\n",
      "all his procl ---- ations announced that those who submitted should be safe in person and property; and his address to all the french people holds out to them that prospect of peace and protection which had long been unknown amongst the dissensions of their nobles.\n",
      "the first person of great influence, however, who joined the forces of the english king, was the duke of brittany; and, though henry exacted no very great exertions from his new ally, the ex ---- ple of such a defection from the crown of france was greatly in behalf of the invader.\n",
      "rouen, the capital of normandy, however, still resolutely closed her gates against the engl ---- h.\n",
      "the attack and capture of the pont de l'arche announced to the people of rouen, and to the king of france, that the war  ----  about to approach the gates of the norman capital, and every exertion was made, both by the burgundian faction, who now held the king in their hands, and the burghers of the city itself, to repel the english in the attempt.\n",
      "a number of f ---- ous knights and commanders were thrown into the city, which was, besides, garrisoned by upward of four thousand men-at-arms, and fifteen thousand armed citizens, all eager in the cause.\n",
      "immense efforts were now made by the english to force an entrance, but the defences of the place were so strong, and the defenders so resolute, that no hope appe ---- d of effecting a practicable breach in the walls.\n",
      "many a sally took place, and many an assault, and many a feat of arms  ----  performed between the two armies.\n",
      "but in the meanwhile the provisions of the people of the town began to decrease, and a smaller and smaller portion of food bec ---- e the allowance of each day.\n",
      "at length the inhabitants, by murmurs and threats, compelled the garrison to treat; and, after a long and painful negotiation, rouen capitulated, upon terms which could hardly be called unfavorable, in the situation to which its defenders  ----  reduced.\n",
      "the news of the fall of rouen had the greatest effect on the rest of normandy, and twenty-seven towns, or castles, immediately made subm ---- sion to the king of england, without even being summoned to surrender.\n",
      "nor  ----  this immediate benefit the only advantage which followed from the capture of rouen.\n",
      "dismay and doubt spread through all france, and thoughts of peace and concession  ----  entertained by those who had hitherto breathed nothing but war and defiance to the king of england.\n",
      "pontoise  ----  almost immediately taken by surprise, gisors and chateau gaillard fell after a short siege, and the terrific news of the advance of the english reached paris, and induced the king, the queen, and the duke of burgundy to abandon the capital and retire to troyes.\n",
      "henry's  ---- bassadors, according to the desire of the french court, were instantly sent to troyes--where the weak king remained under the guidance of his evil wife and her counsellors--and they soon sketched out a treaty by which, on marrying the princess catharine, the english monarch should be declared heir to the crown of france, to the exclusion of the dauphin and his lineage.\n",
      "this hasty treaty  ----  as hastily ratified, and henry, with fifteen thousand men departed from rouen, and marching with all speed to troyes, put the seal to an arrangement which conveyed to him the throne for which he had fought, by marrying the daughter of the french monarch.\n",
      "to the first articles proposed  ----  now added, at the request of henry, that the regency of the kingdom, to the government of which charles was totally incompetent, should be entrusted to him, and no sooner was the solemnity of his marriage completed, than he instantly took the field against the dauphin, leading the unhappy king of france and his whole court against the natural heir to his throne.\n",
      "the town of sens first fell before the arms of england and burgundy, and immediately after siege  ----  laid to montereau, where the assassination of john the bold had been committed.\n",
      "the governors of towns, the officers of state, the magistrates and the dignitaries,  ----  placed and displaced at his pleasure.\n",
      "the currency of the country  ----  altered at his suggestion, and his counsels swayed everything in france.\n",
      "however, england  ----  still at his heart, and leaving a country that his sword and his policy had conquered, as soon as he could do so with any security, he carried his beautiful bride to be crowned in london.\n",
      "the moment, however, that his foot  ----  out of france, his interests in that country declined; and the rashness of his officers brought confusion and ruin into his affairs.\n",
      "town after town was taken by the dauphin; and at length the duke of cl ---- nce, the english monarch's brother, with all the chivalry that accompanied him, were defeated at baugé, in anjou, and the duke himself, as well as three thousand of his men, remained dead upon the field.\n",
      "this news, accompanied by the further tidings that the dauphin  ----  advancing to besiege chartres, called upon the king imperatively to return to france; and leaving the queen to follow at a future time, henry set out for calais accompanied by four thousand men-at-arms and twenty-four thousand archers.\n",
      "h ----  coming gave new courage to the burgundian faction, and struck fear into the followers of the dauphin.\n",
      "scarcely pausing at all in the capital, the english monarch advanced direct toward chartres, before which the dauphin had already been enc ---- ped three weeks; but long ere the english reached the town the gates were free, and the adverse army with all speed retreated toward touraine.\n"

      "huniades counted besides on the assistance of europe; in the first place on the popes, who were zealous advocates of the war against the moh ---- medans; next on venice, which as the first commercial city and state at that time had suffered severe losses owing to the spread of turkish dominions; on the gallant poles whose king now wore the hungarian crown; and lastly upon the peoples of christendom in general, whose enthusiasm for a war against the infidels had been quickened by the report of huniades' victories.\n",
      "and indeed at h ----  request the pope sent some small sums of money, the poles furnished an auxiliary force, while numerous volunteers from the rest of europe flocked to serve under his banner.\n",
      "although the assistance thus furnished  ----  comparatively unimportant, it nevertheless served to increase his zeal for the daring undertaking.\n",
      "he and his heroic companions were not only proud of defending their own native country, but felt that they were the ch ---- pions of all christendom against ottoman aggression, and their religious enthusiasm kept pace with their patriotism.\n",
      "if they did not get regiments sent to their aid, they felt that the eyes of all europe  ----  upon them, ready to grieve at their possible ill success, while their victories would be celebrated by _te deums_ in the cathedrals of every capital in europe.\n",
      "the aggressive c ---- paign was commenced without delay; huniades' resolves were at once translated into fact; he would not allow the beaten foe time to recover breath.\n",
      "his plan  ----  to cross the danube, and penetrate through the passes of the balkan to philippopolis, at that time the capital of the sultan's dominions, where he kept the main body of his army.\n",
      "about christmas, a season in which the turk does not like to fight,  ---- id heavy snow and severe cold, the hungarian army of about thirty thousand men pressed forward.\n",
      "th ----  impediment, coupled with the cold and severe weather, depressed the spirits of the troops, worn out with fatigue.\n",
      "huniades, however, ra ---- ed their spirits by gaining a victory; lighting one night upon a body of the enemy, 20,000 in number, he attacked them at once and after a few hours' struggle succeeded in dispersing them.\n",
      "later on he took two large towns with their citadels; and in three engagements triumphed over three separate div ---- ions of the enemy.\n",
      "learning that a still larger body of turks  ----  attempting to cut off his communications with the king's army he attacked that also and put it to flight.\n",
      "after that he joined h ----  corps with the main army under the king; and indeed none too soon.\n",
      "sultan murad suddenly arrived with the main body of h ----  forces, which he strongly intrenched in the narrowest passes of the balkans.\n",
      "huniades saw that these intrenchments could not be forced, and did all he could to entice h ----  enemy down into the plain.\n",
      "th ----  he succeeded in doing.\n",
      "in the end, however, the hungarians gained the victory, and the younger brother of the grand vizier  ----  taken prisoner.\n",
      "so much success  ----  sufficient for huniades for the time, especially as the natural obstacles had proved insurmountable.\n",
      "the hungarian army returned home in good order, and the young king made a triumphal entry into h ----  capital, preceded by a crowd of turkish prisoners and captured turkish ensigns.\n",
      "these last trophies of victory  ----  deposited in the coronation church in the fortress of buda.\n",
      "and now something happened which had hitherto  ----  deemed incredible; the sultan sued for peace, a true believer and a sovereign, from an unbelieving giaour.\n",
      "the peace was concluded, and hungary again bec ---- e possessed of those dependent (south slavonic) provinces, which lay between the territories of the sultan and the kingdom of hungary in the narrower sense of the word.\n",
      "the sultan, however, soon repented of what he had done, and continually delayed the fulfilment of h ----  promise to evacuate certain frontier fortresses.\n",
      "for th ----  cause the young king, especially incited thereto by the pope, determined to renew the war.\n",
      "huniades at first opposed the king's resolution, and wished to wait; later on he  ----  gained over to the king's view, and took up the matter with his whole soul.\n",
      "the opportunity  ----  inviting, for the sultan with his main army was engaged somewhere in asia, and the venetians promised to prevent with their fleet his return to europe across the narrow seas in the neighborhood of constantinople.\n",
      "they  ----  to be joined by their allies at the town of varna on the shores of the black sea.\n",
      "when, however, the hungarians had arrived at that town, they found no trace of their expected allies, but on the contrary learned with certainty that the sultan had succeeded in eluding the vigilance of the venetians, had brought his army in small boats over into europe, and  ----  now following fast on their track.\n",
      "thus all hope of aid from allies was at an end, the brave general and his small hungarian force had to rely on their own resources, separated as they  ----  by some weeks' journey from their own country, while the enemy would be soon upon them in numbers five times their own.\n",
      "the proverb says: \"if thy sword  ----  short, lengthen it by a step forward.\"\n",
      "and huniades boldly, but yet with the caution that behoved a c ---- ful general, took up his position before the sultan's army.\n",
      "both he and h ----  hungarians fought with dauntless courage, availing themselves of every advantage and beating back every assault.\n",
      "already victory seemed to  ----  assured.\n",
      "a few hours after the battle had begun both the turkish wings had been broken, and even the sultan and the brave janissaries were thinking of flight, when the young king, the pole vladislaus, whom huniades had adjured by god to remain in a place of safety, until the combat should be decided, was persuaded by his polish suite to fling himself with the small band in immediate attendance upon him right on the centre of the janissaries, so that he too might have a sh ----  in the victory and not leave it all to huniades.\n",
      "the jan ---- saries wavered for a moment under this new and unexpected attack, but soon perceiving that they had to do with the king of hungary they closed round his band which had penetrated far into their ranks.\n",
      "the king's horse was first h ---- strung, and, as it fell, the king's head was severed from his body, stuck upon the point of a spear and exposed to the view of both armies.\n",
      "the hungarians, shocked at the unexpected sight, wavered and, feeling themselves lost,  ---- gan to fly.\n",
      "all the entreaties and exhortations of huniades  ----  in vain.\n",
      "such  ----  the confusion that he could be neither seen nor heard, and in a few minutes the whole hungarian army was in confused flight.\n",
      "alone, deserted by all, he had to make h ----  way from one place of concealment to another till after some weeks' wandering he arrived in hungary.\n",
      "the bad news had preceded him; and in consequence everything  ----  in confusion.\n",
      "again arose that difficult question: who should  ----  the new king under such difficult circumstances?\n",
      "the nation  ----  disposed to choose for its king the child, ladislaus, son of king albert, the predecessor of vladislaus.\n",
      "the child, however,  ----  in the power of the neighboring prince, frederick, the archduke of austria, who was not disposed to let him go out of his hands without a heavy ransom.\n",
      "under these circumstances the more powerful nobles in hungary took advantage of the confusion to strengthen each h ----  own position at the expense of the nation.\n",
      "at first the government of the country  ----  entrusted to a number of captains, but this proved so evidently disastrous that the better sort of people succeeded in having them abolished and huniades established as sole governor.\n",
      "for all that, however, huniades had a good deal of trouble with the chief ar ---- tocrats, garay, czillei, ujlaki, who, envying the parvenu his sudden promotion and despising his obscure origin, took up arms to resist his authority.\n",
      "thus huniades, instead of blunting the edge of h ----  sword upon foreign foes, had to bridle the insubordination of his own countrymen.\n",
      "luckily it did not take long to force the d ---- contented to own the weight of his arm and his superiority as a military leader.\n",
      "order being thus to some extent re-established at home, huniades  ----  again able to turn his attention to the turks.\n",
      "he felt that he had in fact gained the battle of varna, which  ----  only lost through the jealous humor of a youthful king; that it behoved him not to stop half way; that it was his duty to continue offensive operations.\n",
      "but in so doing he had to rely upon h ----  own proper forces.\n",
      "it is true that he was governor of the country, but for the purpose of offensive warf ----  beyond the frontier he could not gain the consent of the great nobles.\n",
      "luckily h ----  private property had enormously increased by this time.\n",
      "the hungarian constitution ordered the king to bestow the estates of such noblemen, as died without male heirs or had  ----  condemned for any offence, on such noblemen as had approved themselves valiant defenders of the country.\n",
      "now where could be found a more worthy recipient of such estates than huniades, to whom the public treasury was besides a debtor on account of the sums he disbursed for the constant warf ----  he maintained against the turks?\n",
      "especially in the south of hungary a whole series of lordly estates, many of them belonging to the crown, had come into huniades' hands, either as pledges for the repayment of the money he had paid h ----  soldiers, or as his own private property.\n",
      "the yearly revenue arising from these vast estates  ----  employed by huniades not in personal expenditure but in the defence of his country.\n",
      "he himself lived as simply as anyone of his soldiers, and recognized no other use of money than as a weapon to be used for the defence of christendom against isl ---- .\n",
      "in the early morn while all h ----  suite still slept he passed hours in prayer before the altar in the dimly lighted church, imploring the help of the almighty for the attainment of his sole object in life--the destruction of the turkish power.\n",
      "at last (1448) he set out against the sultan with a picked army of 24,000 of h ----  most trusty soldiers.\n",
      "this time it  ----  on the frontier of servia, on the so-called field of blackbirds, that huniades encountered sultan murad, as before with an army of 150,000 men--more than five times the number of the christians.\n",
      "huniades at first withdrew himself into his intrenched c ---- p, but in a few days felt himself strong enough to engage with the enemy on the open field.\n",
      "huniades himself  ----  several times in deadly peril.\n",
      "once his horse  ----  shot under him.\n",
      "he was to be found wherever assistance, support, encouragement  ----  needed.\n",
      "at last on the morning of the third day as the turks who had received reinforcements  ----  about to renew the attack, the voyvode of wallachia passed over to the side of the turks.\n",
      "the voyvode  ---- longed to the orthodox eastern church.\n",
      "he had joined huniades on the way, and h ----  desertion transferred 6,000 men from one side to the other, and decided the battle in favor of the turks.\n",
      "the hungarians, worn out by fatigue, fell into a d ---- couragement, while huniades had no fresh troops to bring up to their support.\n",
      "the battle c ---- e to a sudden end.\n",
      "seventeen thousand hungarian corpses strewed the field, but the loss of the turks  ----  more than 30,000 men.\n",
      "huniades again left to himself had again to make h ----  escape.\n",
      "at first he only d ---- missed his military suite; afterwards he separated from his faithful servant in the hope that separately they might more easily baffle their pursuers.\n",
      "next he had to turn his horse adrift, as the poor animal  ----  incapable of continuing his journey.\n",
      "thus he made h ----  way alone and on foot toward the frontiers of his native land.\n",
      "he thus escaped th ----  danger, but only to encounter another.\n",
      "at a turn of the road he c ---- e so suddenly upon a party of turkish plunderers as to be unable to escape from them, and thus became their prisoner.\n",
      "but the turks did not recognize him, and leaving him in the hands of two of their num ---- r the rest went on in search of more prey.\n",
      "his two guards soon c ---- e to blows with one another about a heavy gold cross which they had found on the person of their captive, and, while they were thus quarrelling, huniades suddenly wrenched his sword out of the hand of one of the two turks and cut off his head, upon which the other took to flight, and huniades was again free.\n",
      "in the meantime, however, george, the prince of servia, who took part with the aristocratic malcontents, and out of pure hatred to huniades had, in spite of his being a christian, gone over to the side of the turks, had given strict orders that all hungarian stragglers  ----  to be apprehended and brought before him.\n",
      "in th ----  way huniades fell into the hands of some servian peasants who delivered him to their prince.\n",
      "nor did he regain h ----  liberty without the payment of a heavy ransom, leaving his son, ladislaus, as hostage in his stead.\n",
      "he thus returned home  ---- id a thousand perils and with the painful experience that europe left him to his own resources to fight as he best could against the ever-advancing turks.\n",
      "the dependencies of the hungarian crown, servia and wallachia, on whose recovery he had spent so much blood and treasure, instead of supporting him as might be expected of chr ---- tian countries threw themselves in a suicidal manner into the arms of the turks.\n",
      "they hoped by their ready submission to find favor in the eyes of the irresistible conquerors, by whom, however, they  ----  a little later on devoured.\n",
      "after these events huniades continued to act as governor or regent of hungary for five years more, by which time the young lad ---- laus, son of king albert, attained his majority.\n",
      "in 1453 he finally laid down h ----  dignity as governor, and gave over the power into the hands of the young king, ladislaus v., whom huniades had first to liberate by force of arms from his uncle, frederick of austria, before he could set him on the throne of hungary.\n",
      "the young king, of german origin had, however, hardly become emancipated from h ----  guardian, when he fell under the influence of his other uncle, ulric czillei.\n",
      "this czillei  ----  a great nobleman of styria, but was withal possessed of large estates in hungary.\n",
      "as a foreigner and as a relative of king sig ---- mund, he had long viewed with an evil eye huniades' elevation.\n",
      "on one occasion huniades had to inflict pun ---- hment on him.\n",
      "he consequently now did everything he could to induce the young king, h ----  nephew, to hate the great captain as he himself did.\n",
      "he sought to infuse jealousy into h ----  mind and to lead him to believe that huniades aimed at the crown.\n",
      "his slanders found the readier credence in the mind of the youthful sovereign as he  ----  completely stupefied by an uninterrupted course of debauchery.\n",
      "at last the king  ----  brought to agree to a plan for ensnaring the great man who so often jeoparded his life and his substance in the defence of his country and religion.\n",
      "they summoned him in the king's n ---- e to vienna, where ladislaus as an austrian prince was then staying, with the intention of waylaying and murdering him.\n",
      "but huniades got wind of the whole plot, and, when he arrived at the place of  ---- bush, it was at the head of 2,000 picked hungarian warriors.\n"

      "cæsar and cromwell, mahomet and napoleon, to mention no others,  ----  such men, and such a man was hernando cortes, the conqueror of mexico.\n",
      "they have been called, and well called, men of destiny, since it is impossible in studying their lives and tracing their vast influence upon human affairs, to avoid the conclusion that they  ----  raised up and endowed with great talents and opportunities in order that by their agency the ends of providence might be shaped.\n",
      "hernando cortes was born of a good f ---- ily, at the town of medellin in spain, in 1485, and educated at the college of salamanca.\n",
      "at the age of nineteen having proved himself unfit to follow the profession of the law to which his p ---- nts had destined him, he emigrated to the indian island of hispaniola where he was appointed notary of the town of acua, and in 1511 assisted in the conquest of cuba under the command of velasquez.\n",

      "after much intriguing and in consideration of the payment of a considerable sum of money toward the expenses, cortes whose  ---- bitious spirit had already wearied of a life of peace and indolence, contrived to persuade velasquez to appoint him captain general of the expedition.\n",
      "before the ships sailed, however, velasquez repented him of the appointment, for in cortes he recognized a servant who might well become h ----  master, and made arrangements to invest some other hidalgo with the leadership of the expedition.\n",

      "many in his position on learning the wishes of their superior would have t ---- ely yielded up their posts.\n",
      "not so cortes, who on the first hint that he was to be deprived of his authority, collected his men, and all unprep ---- d as was his squadron, weighed anchor while the governor slept.\n",
      "at the town of trinidad he landed to collect stores and volunteers, treating with contempt the orders that reached the commander of the town from velasquez to depose him from h ----  command and detain his person.\n",
      "here it was that cortes made his f ---- ous address to the volunteers, wherein he shows that although his instructions were to undertake a trading voyage and acquire information of the country, his real aim was far different, since he promises unimagined wealth to those who are true to him, and by a curious flash of prescience prophesies immortal renown to their enterprise.\n",
      "cortes  ----  in his thirty-fourth year when he entered on this the greatest of his enterprises.\n",

      "he dressed richly and  ----  constant in his religious exercises.\n",

      "having touched at the  ---- land of cozumel on the coast of yucatan, cortes sailed up the tabasco river and began his work of conquest by attacking a great army of indians in the neighborhood of that town.\n",
      "for a while the natives held their own notwithstanding their d ---- may at the sound and effects of fire-arms; but the appearance of the horsemen, whom they took to be strange animals, caused them to flee in terror leaving many hundreds of their warriors dead upon the field.\n",
      "on the morrow they made their subm ---- sion, bringing women and other gifts as a peace-offering.\n",
      " ---- ong these women was one named malinche, or by the spaniards marina, whom cortes took as a mistress and who is described by camargo as having been \"beautiful as a goddess.\"\n",
      "it  ----  this lady, born to be the evil genius of her country, who instructed her lord and master in the habits, traditions, and history of the aztecs, and of the land of anahuac which they inhabited together with other tribes.\n",
      "she  ----  cortes' interpreter and confidante, whose business it was to gain information from the indians, which he could use, and whose wit and devotion more than once saved him from disaster.\n",
      "so invaluable were her services to cortes that it is doubtful if without her aid he would have succeeded in conquering mexico, and it was from her that he acquired the n ---- e of malinche by which he was known among the indian races.\n",
      "her reward, when she had served his purpose and he  ----  weary of her, was to be given by him in marriage to another man.\n",
      "in due course envoys arrived from the monarch laden with magnificent gifts, who delivered a civil but none the less peremptory message requesting the spaniards to return whence they c ---- e.\n",
      "by this time cortes had learned that although the aztecs  ----  the greatest power in anahuac, their supremacy was not acknowledged by all the tribes; notably was it contested by the tlascalans and their allies the otomies.\n",
      "the tlascalans  ----  republicans having their home in the mountains almost midway between mexico and the coast.\n",
      "for fifty years or more they had  ----  at bitter enmity with the aztecs, who again and again had vainly attempted to subjugate them.\n",
      "to th ----  people cortes despatched an embassy asking for a safe passage through their territories on his road to mexico, for his political insight told him that they might prove valuable allies.\n",
      "no answer was returned by the tlascalans who when the spaniards advanced attacked them furiously, only to be defeated by cortes in several engagements, till, discouraged and believing the white men to be invincible, they sued for peace, and from enemies  ----  converted into firm allies.\n",
      "from tlascala the spaniards proceeded to the neighboring city of cholula where marina d ---- covered a plot to put them to death.\n",
      "for th ----  offence cortes took a terrible vengeance.\n",
      "falling on the inhabitants of the city when they were unprep ---- d he butchered vast numbers of them, giving their houses and temples to sack.\n",
      "having thus established the terror of his n ---- e he marched on to mexico accompanied by a body of about five thousand tlascalan allies.\n",

      "thus it c ---- e about that without a blow being struck to drive them back cortes and his little band of adventurers found themselves established at the heart of the strange and rich civilization that they had discovered, not as enemies, but as the guests of the king.\n",
      "they  ----  not slow to avail themselves of the opportunities of their position in order to advance their ends which were, first plunder, secondly conquest, and, thirdly the extension of the authority of spain and of the christian religion.\n",
      "in pursuit of these ends upon some slight pretext cortes seized the person of montezuma, the great emperor, and imprisoned him in one of his own palaces whence, however, he  ----  still allowed to direct the government and issue his commands.\n",
      "accordingly eighteen vessels containing nearly a thousand white men were placed under the command of panfilo de narvaez, and reached vera cruz in april, 1520. when cortes heard of the arrival of this arm ---- ent and its object which was to punish him for his supposed rebellion, he marched from mexico, leaving the little garrison and the person of montezuma in charge of his comrade alvarado.\n",
      "although he had with him but two hundred and fifty men in all, he did not hesitate to hazard a night attack upon narvaez who was strongly enc ---- ped at cempoalla.\n",
      "it  ----  completely successful; narvaez was wounded, captured, and sent in chains to vera cruz, while the army that had come to conquer him swore allegiance to cortes as captain-general and marched with him back to mexico.\n",
      "here great events  ----  in progress.\n",
      "moved to the deed by fear or by the discovery of some real or fancied plot against the spaniards, alvarado, the deputy of cortes, had fallen upon the unarmed aztec nobles while they  ----  celebrating a feast in the courtyard of the great temple, and butchered some six hundred of them with every circumstance of brutality.\n",
      "then at last the patient aztecs rose and until the womanly montezuma begged them to desist, attacked the palace where the spaniards  ----  quartered, with fury.\n",
      "at the intervention of their monarch the attack  ----  turned to a blockade and cortes arrived from his victory over narvaez to find his companions in desperate straits.\n",
      "they assaulted and captured the great pyr ---- id, putting to the sword the priests of human sacrifice and burning the blood-stained temples of the gods.\n",
      "it  ----  in the course of one of these attacks that montezuma received the wound that brought about his death.\n",
      "mounting the central tower of the palace he implored h ----  subjects to cease from attacking his friends the spaniards, whereupon in their fury they overwhelmed him with a shower of darts and stones, inflicting injuries from which in course of a few days he died.\n",
      "surrounded as he  ----  on every side by thousands of fierce enemies determined to stretch every spaniard upon the stone of sacrifice, cortes saw the impossibility of maintaining the unequal fight and determined on retreat.\n",
      "soon their escape  ----  detected and instantly a fierce attack was made upon them from every quarter.\n",
      "the bridge that they had brought with them to span the gaps in the causeway bec ---- e fixed in the mud, so that their only path across the canals lay over the bodies of their comrades.\n",
      "at length they won through, but out of their small force there had per ---- hed, or been taken captive as victims for sacrifice, some four hundred and fifty spaniards and four thousand native allies.\n",
      "it  ----  said that when the shattered army reached a place of safety outside the city, cortes sat down beneath an ancient cedar-tree which is still shown to travellers, and wept.\n",
      "yet within a week fortune smiled on him again, for he and the few comrades who remained to him fought and won the battle of otompan against thousands of the indians, cortes killing their chief cihuaca with h ----  own hand.\n",
      "the aztecs rejoiced at the departure of the spaniards from their capital mexico or tenoctitlan, but their joy  ----  premature.\n",
      "first the small-pox, introduced into the country by the white men, fell upon the city and swept away thousands,  ---- ong them cuitlahua, the emperor who succeeded to montezuma, and then came the news that the indomitable cortes was marching upon them with a great army of native allies and large reinforcements of spaniards from overseas.\n",
      "guatimozin, the new emperor, made every possible preparation for defence and the siege  ---- gan, a siege as cruel as that of jerusalem and perhaps more bloody.\n",
      "first cortes laid waste the cities about mexico, then he attacked the queen of the valley herself--attacked it again and again till at length it was a ruin and tens of thousands of its inhabitants  ----  dead by starvation, by pestilence, and by the sword.\n",
      "on either side the combat  ----  one of desperate courage, but notwithstanding occasional successes on the part of the aztecs, such as that when they captured and sacrificed some sixty spaniards, from the first the genius of cortes made the end inevitable.\n",
      "when nothing remained of tenoctitlan and its people save some blackened walls and a few thousand wretches reduced to skeletons by hunger, the capture of guatimozin while attempting to escape in a canoe, made an end of the fighting in august, 1521. cortes prom ---- ed honorable treatment to the fallen king, but before long he put him and some of his companions to the torture in order to force the discovery of hidden treasure.\n",
      "this brutality proved ineffectual, but taken together with the subsequent hanging of guatimozin upon an unproved charge of conspiracy against the spaniards, it constitutes the blackest blot upon the f ---- e of cortes.\n",
      "it is fair to add, however, that he was not by nature a harsh man, and that he was driven to the commission of these cruelties by the cl ---- or of his soldiers who were infuriated at finding so little treasure in the devastated city.\n",
      "he  ----  appointed captain-general of the land of new spain in october, 1522, and the next few years he occupied in rebuilding the city, and in bringing the surrounding territories under the rule of spain.\n",
      "wearying of these comparatively peaceful occupations, in 1524 he undertook an expedition of discovery and conquest to honduras, upon which he  ----  absent until may, 1526, when he returned after enduring much hardship and suffering, to find that enemies had been plotting against him in mexico.\n",
      "th ----  discovery and the desire of clearing himself with the emperor, caused him to determine to visit spain where he arrived in may, 1528. charles the fifth received him with much favor creating him marquis of the valley of oaxaca and military commander of new spain, and endowing him with vast estates in the lands that he had conquered.\n",
      "in 1530 he returned to mexico accompanied by his second wife, a lady of good f ---- ily whom he had married while in spain.\n",
      "very soon he entered on a course of expeditions of d ---- covery and maritime adventures which involved him in great pecuniary losses and a quarrel with the viceroy mendoza; and in 1540 he sailed a second time for spain to obtain redress from the emperor.\n",
      "but cortes was no longer the power that he had been; his youth was gone and his work was done, therefore his prayers and remonstrances  ----  treated with cold neglect.\n",
      "for nearly four years he pressed h ----  suit and in february, 1544, we find him writing a letter to the emperor begging him to direct the council of the indies to come to a decision upon it.\n",
      "th ----  letter in which pathetically enough, he speaks of himself as \"old and poor and indebted,\" produced no result and once again, worn out and bitterly disappointed, its writer turned his face toward the land that he had won for spain.\n",
      "but he  ----  never to behold it more.\n",
      "at seville he  ----  seized with dysentery and passed away december 2, 1547, being then in his sixty-third year.\n",
      "his body  ----  taken to mexico for burial.\n",
      "in hernando cortes died one of the great men of the world, though how much of his greatness  ----  due to chance is difficult to determine.\n",
      "it is certain that again and again fortune stood his friend in a manner that was little short of miraculous, as in the instances of the unexpected victory over narvaez and of the death of the general at the battle of ot ---- pan.\n",
      "but if chance or fate gave him opportunities it  ----  cortes' own genius and unconquerable will that enabled him to avail himself of them.\n",
      "these qualities  ----  the most striking characteristics of the man.\n",
      "he showed them when having determined on the conquest of mexico he burnt h ----  ships that there might be no escape from the decision; when he hit upon the expedient of using rival tribes to accomplish the overthrow of the aztecs; when, driven from mexico with the loss of the half of his army he returned to the attack; and in many another time and place.\n",
      "he had great good qualities, he was a true friend, and according to his lights, an honorable and even a religious man, and his faults were those of his time and training, or at worst such as  ----  not inconsistent with a generous nature.\n",
      "h ----  cruelties may be urged against him, but no spaniard of his age thought it cruel to slaughter enemies of the faith who practised human sacrifice; also having once embarked upon his colossal undertaking he and his companions must either slay or be slain.\n",
      "there is evidence to show that personally he  ----  not a cruel man.\n",
      "thus when called upon to sign the death-warrant of a soldier he l ---- ented that he had ever been taught to write, and there are passages in his will which show his conscience to have been troubled by questions as to the right to enslave human beings.\n",
      "with a handful of followers cortes overthrew the fabric of the aztec empire, broke the spirit of its people so effectually that to th ----  day it has not recovered itself, and swept away its religion.\n",

      "the huguenots (as the followers of the reformed faith in that country were termed) formed the most influential, if not the largest part of the population of many of the principal provinces, and of nearly all the provincial capitals; they were numerous in paris; nor was there a single district or town in france in which they had not obtained converts and power, before the war of 1562. the history of the reformation in france is a mournful one; but it presents n ---- es to our notice which every good heart must delight to honor; and foremost of these is the name of gaspard de coligni, the statesman, the soldier, and the saint; who long was the stoutest champion of the protestant cause, and finally became the most glorious of its many martyrs.\n",
      "unlike his comrade condé, he was proof against the vicious blandishments of the enemy's court, as well as against the terrors of their c ---- ps.\n",
      "f ---- iliar with defeat, he never learned despair.\n",

      "the father of coligni  ----  head of an ancient and noble house, and was the seigneur of châtillon-sur-lion.\n",
      "at his death, in 1522, he left three sons, then of tender years, all of whom bec ---- e eminent in french history, and all of whom embraced the protestant doctrines, though trained up in the romish church.\n",
      "the elder brother, who is known as the cardinal de châtillon, was raised to that high ecclesiastical dignity by clement vii., in 1533. chiefly through the influence which his younger brother exerted over him, he bec ---- e a convert to the tenets of the reformers in his middle age, and took part in the early scenes of the civil wars.\n",
      "after the reverse which his party sustained at the battle of st. denys, he fled to england, where he died in 1571. the younger brother, dandelot, was the first of the three who bec ---- e a protestant.\n",
      "he  ----  a skilful and gallant soldier, and signalized himself repeatedly by his enterprise, his inexhaustible resources, and undaunted spirit, as a commander of the huguenot forces from the first outbreak of the religious wars until his death soon after the battle of jarnac, in 1569. gaspard, the great coligni, or the admiral (as he is often termed, from having held the titular office of admiral of france), was the middle one of the three brothers, and was born at châtillon-sur-lion, february 16, 1517. he served with distinction in the later wars of francis i. against spain; and with his brother dandelot received knighthood on the field of battle at cerisoles.\n",
      "he  ----  afterward raised to the important post of colonel-general of the french infantry, and in 1552 was nominated by henry ii.\n",
      "he  ----  taken prisoner at st. quentin by the spaniards, and underwent a long captivity in spain before he regained his liberty by payment of a heavy ransom.\n",
      "during the long hours of solitude and compulsory inaction which he passed in h ----  spanish prison, he meditated deeply and earnestly on religious subjects; and after his return to france, the conversation of his brother dandelot, who had already joined the huguenots, confirmed the bias to the protestant doctrines, which his own studies and deliberations had created.\n",
      "coligni now resigned all h ----  appointments and preferments, except the nominal rank of admiral, and retired to his estates, where he passed his time in fervent devotion, and in the enjoyment of the calm happiness of domestic life.\n",

      "he at first sought to provide for them a refuge from oppression, by founding colonies of french protestants in  ---- erica; but his projects proved unsuccessful; and as the tyranny of the violent party among the french catholics grew more and more alarming, coligni deemed that both honor and conscience required him to stand openly forward in behalf of his co-religionists.\n",

      "mackintosh, in his \"history of the english revolution of 1688,\" has truly termed the question of when subjects  ----  justified in making war on their sovereign, \"a tremendous problem.\"\n",
      "but the s ---- e admirable writer has bequeathed to us a full and luminous code of the rules and principles of immutable morality, by which this awful issue must be tried, and no one who is familiar with these principles can hesitate in pronouncing that the war on the part of the french huguenots was lawful and laudable before god and man.\n",
      "coligni  ----  peculiarly free from the heavy imputation, which insurrectionary leaders incur, however great their provocation, who introduce the appeal of battle in civil controversy, and, to use the emphatic language of milton, \"let loose the sword of intestine war, soaking the land in her own gore,\" before every other possible mode of obtaining protection from further enormous wrong has been attempted, and attempted in vain.\n",
      "he was wholly unconnected with the enterprise (known in french history as the conspiracy of  ---- boise) by which some of the protestant chiefs designed to withdraw the young king, francis ii., forcibly from the influence of the guises, and which may be considered the first overt act of insurrection.\n",
      "not that condé  ----  to be condemned for that effort, but the admiral's exceeding loyalty is proved by his having kept aloof from it.\n",
      "coligni continued to seek security for h ----  co-religionists by peaceable means, for two years after that unsuccessful enterprise, from the savage reprisals of the court upon its authors.\n",
      "he seemed at one time to be successful in his bl ---- eless exertions; and in the assembly of notables, held in january, 1562, an edict was issued, called the \"edict of pacification,\" giving a partial toleration of the protestant creed, and suspending all penal proceedings on the ground of religion.\n",
      "this  ----  all that coligni strove for.\n",
      "he said at the time to some of h ----  adherents: \"if we have our religion, what do we want more?\"\n",

      "catherine dreaded the power of the house of guise; and  ----  often glad to avail herself of the protestant interest as a counterpoise against them.\n",
      "but though the jealousy which animated herself and her sons against the princes of lorraine  ----  great, their hatred of the huguenots was greater; and their occasional simulation of friendship enabled them to wreak it more malignantly and more completely.\n",
      "they had sided with coligni and condé and the other protestant chiefs in enacting the edict of pacification, and had thereby given a check to the power of the duke of gu ---- e and his confederates.\n",
      "but when their temporary purpose was served, the wise provisions of that edict  ----  set at naught; the protestants were again exposed to outrage and slaughter at the hands of their foes, nor could any redress be obtained from the royal tribunals.\n",
      "at length occurred the massacre of vassi, where the armed followers of the duke of gu ---- e attacked a defenceless body of protestants, while engaged in the services of their church, and slaughtered several hundreds of them under the eye of guise, if not by his orders.\n",
      "reeking from this carnage, the bands of the lorraines entered paris, where they  ----  enthusiastically received by the fanatic populace, which was devoted to the catholic cause.\n",
      "coligni long delayed joining him, and evinced a hesitation and a reluctance to embark in civil war, which emphatically attest the goodness while they in no degree detract from the greatness of h ----  character.\n",
      "h ----  wife, who naturally thought that anxiety on her account aided in restraining him, exhorted him in words of more than roman magnanimity to arm in defence of the thousand destined victims, who looked up to him for guidance and protection.\n",
      "coligni urged on her and on the friends who thronged round him, the fearful r ---- ks of the enterprise, and his earnest desire to wait in patience for better times, and rest upon the public faith rather than justify persecution by having recourse to violence.\n",

      "the treaty of st. germains  ----  signed on august 8, 1570, and on august 24, 1572, the massacre of st. bartholomew attested with what worse than punic faith the crowned conspirators of the french court had planned it.\n",

      "this handful of bold men attacked the town, which  ----  unwalled, on the night of july 22d, and found their way to the marketplace, where the captain received a severe wound.\n",
      "he concealed his hurt until the public treasury was reached; but before it could be broken open, he bec ---- e faint from loss of blood, and his disheartened followers abandoned the attempt, and carried him perforce on board ship.\n",
      "such at least,  ----  the account of the english; there is a portuguese statement in \"hakluyt's voyages,\" vol.\n",
      "failing in this attempt, drake continued for some time on the coast, visiting carthagena and other places, and making prize of various ships; and if we wonder at his hardihood in adventuring with such scanty means to remain for months in the midst of an awakened and inveterate enemy, how much more surprising is it that the wealthy, proud, and powerful monarchy of spain should so neglect the c ----  of its most precious colonies, as to leave them unable to crush so slight a foe!\n",
      "the english appear to have felt perfectly at their ease; they cruised about, formed an intimate alliance with an indian tribe, n ---- ed symerons, the bond of union being a common hatred of the spaniards, and built a fort on a small island of difficult access, at the mouth of a river, where they remained from september 24 to february 3, 1573. on the latter day, drake set forth with one portion of his associates, under the conduct of the symerons, to cross the isthmus.\n",
      "on the fourth day they reached a central hill, where stood a remarkable \"goodly and great high tree, in which the indians had cut and made divers steps to ascend up neere unto the top, where they had also made a convenient bower, wherein ten or twelve men might easily sitt; and from thence wee might without any difficulty plainly see the atlantic ocean, whence now wee c ---- e, and the south atlantic (_i.e._, pacific), so much desired.\n",
      "after our captain had ascended to th ----  bower with the chief symeron, and having, as it pleased god at that time, by reason of the brize, a very faire day, had seen that sea of which he had heard such golden reports, he besought almighty god of his goodness to give him life and leave to sayle once in an english ship in that sea.\"\n",
      "we quote from a tract entitled \"sir franc ----  drake revived,\" written by some of drake's companions, corrected, it is said, by himself, and published by his nephew in 1626, which contains a full and interesting account of this adventurous expedition.\n",
      "drake's present object was to intercept a convoy of treasure on the way from pan ---- a to nombre de dios.\n",
      "by this route the treasures of peru and chili, as well as mexico,  ----  brought to europe, for the passage round cape horn was then unknown, and no ship but magellan's had yet accomplished the passage round the world to europe.\n",
      "guided by the symerons, the english approached pan ---- a, learned that a valuable treasure was expected to pass, and beset the lonely forest road which it had to travel.\n",
      "but the haste of one drunken man gave a premature alarm, in consequence of which the march of the caravan was stopped; and drake with his party, their golden hopes being thus defeated, forced their way through venta cruz, and returned by a shorter route to their enc ---- pment, after a toilsome and fruitless journey of three weeks.\n",
      "it  ----  not till april 1st, that the long-desired opportunity presented itself, on which day they took a caravan of mules laden with silver and a small quantity of gold.\n",
      "they carried off part of the spoil, and buried about fifteen tons of silver; but on returning for it, they found that it had  ----  recovered by the spaniards.\n",
      "drake returned to england, august 9, 1573. in dividing the treasure he showed the strictest honor, and even generosity; yet his sh ----  was large enough to pay for fitting out three ships, with which he served as a volunteer in ireland, under the earl of essex, and \"did excellent service both by sea and land in the winning of divers strong forts.\"\n",
      "in 1577, he obtained a comm ---- sion from queen elizabeth to conduct a squadron into the south seas.\n",
      "what  ----  the purport of the commission we do not find; it appears from subsequent passages that it gave to drake the power of life and death over his followers; but it would seem from the queen's hesitation in approving his proceedings, that it was not intended to authorize (at least formally) his depradations on spanish property.\n",
      "with five ships, the largest the pelican, of one hundred tons burden, the smallest a pinnace of fifteen tons, manned in all with only 164 men, drake sailed from plymouth, november 15, 1577, to v ---- it seas where no english vessel had ever sailed.\n",
      "without serious loss, or adventure worthy of notice, the fleet arrived at port st. julian, on the coast of patagonia, june 20, 1578. here the discoverer magellan had tried and executed his second in command on the charge of mutiny, and the s ---- e spot did drake select to perform a similar tragedy.\n",
      "he accused the officer next to himself, thomas doughty, of plots to defeat the expedition and take h ----  life; plots undertaken, he said, before they had left england.\n",
      "\"proofs were required and alleged, so many and so evident, that the gentleman himself, stricken with remorse, acknowledged himself to have deserved death;\" and of three things presented to him, either immediate execution, or to be set on shore on the main, or to be sent home to answer for his conduct, he chose the former; and having at his own request received the sacr ---- ent, together with drake, and dined with him in further token of amity, he cheerfully laid his head on the block, according to the sentence pronounced by forty of the chiefest persons in the fleet.\n",
      "such is the account published by drake's nephew, in \"the world encompassed,\" of which we shall only observe, without passing judgment on the action, that drake's conduct in taking out a person whom he knew to be ill affected to him,  ----  as singular as is the behavior and sudden and acute penitence attributed to doughty.\n",
      "it is fair to state the judgment of c ---- den, who says, \"that the more unprejudiced men in the fleet thought doughty had been guilty of insubordination, and that drake in jealousy removed him as a rival.\n",
      "but some persons, who thought they could see farther than others, said that drake had  ----  ordered by the earl of leicester to take off doughty, because he spread a report that leicester had procured the death of the earl of essex.\"\n",
      "having remained at port st. julian until august 15th, they sailed for the straits, reached them august 20th, and passed safely into the pacific, septem ---- r 6th, with three ships, having taken out the men and stores, and abandoned the two smaller vessels.\n",
      "but there arose on the 7th a dreadful storm, which d ---- persed the ships.\n",
      "the marigold  ----  no more heard of, while the dispirited crew of the elizabeth returned to england, being the first who ever passed back to the eastward through magellan's strait.\n",
      "drake's ship was driven southward to the fifty-sixth degree, where he ran in  ---- ong the islands of the extreme south of america.\n",
      "he fixes the farthest land to be near the fifty-sixth degree of south latitude, and thus appears to claim the honor of having d ---- covered cape horn.\n",
      "from september 7th to october 28th, the adventurers were buffeted by one continued and dreadful storm; and in estimating the merits of our intrepid se ---- en, it is to be considered that the seas were utterly unknown, and feared by all, those who had tried to follow in magellan's course having seldom succeeded, and then with much pain and loss, and little fruit of their voyage; that their vessels were of a class which is now hardly used for more than coasting service; and that the imperfection of instruments and observations laid them under disadvantages which are now removed by the ingenuity of our artists.\n",
      "add to this, that as the spaniards gave out that it was impossible to repass the straits, there remained no known way to quit the hostile shores of  ---- erica, but by traversing the unexplored pacific.\n",
      "the storm at length ceased, and the lonely pelican (which drake, however, had ren ---- ed the golden hind) ran along the coast of lima and peru, reaping a golden harvest from the careless security of those who never thought to see an enemy on that side of the globe.\n",
      "there is something rather revolting, but very indicative of the temper of the age, in the constant reference to the guidance and protection of god, mixed with a quiet jocularity with which \"master francis fletcher, preacher in this employment,\" from whose notes the \"world encompassed,\" which is a narrative of this voyage, was compiled, speaks of acts very little different from highway robbery, such as would now be held disgraceful in open war; as for instance, on meeting a spaniard driving eight ll ---- as, each laden with one hundred pounds' weight of silver, \"they offered their service without entreaty, and became drovers, not enduring to see a gentleman spaniard turned carrier.\"\n",
      "enriched by the most valuable spoil, jewels, gold, and silver, drake steered to the northward, hoping to d ---- cover a homeward passage in that quarter.\n",
      "in the forty-eighth degree of north latitude, in what is now the state of washington, he was stopped by the cold; and, determining to traverse the pacific, he landed, careened his ship, and, in the queen's n ---- e, took possession of the country, which he named new albion, september 29, 1579; he sailed again, and reached the molucca islands november 4th.\n",
      "in h ----  passage thence to the island of celebes, he incurred the most imminent danger of the whole voyage.\n",
      "the ship struck, as they  ----  sailing before a fair wind, on a reef of rocks, so precipitous that it was impossible to lay out an anchor to heave her off.\n",
      "they stuck fast in th ----  most hazardous situation for eight hours.\n",
      "had the sea r ---- en, she must have been wrecked.\n",
      "this  ----  drake's last mishap.\n",
      "accounts differ as to the exact date of h ----  arrival.\n",
      "since drake had for this voyage the queen's commission, by which we must suppose the license to rob the spaniards to have been at least tacitly conceded, he seems to have been rather hardly used, in being left from november to april in ignorance how his bold adventure  ----  received at court.\n",
      " ---- ong the people it created a great sensation, with much diversity of opinion; some commending it as a notable instance of english valor and maritime skill, and a just reprisal upon the spaniards for their faithless and cruel practices; others styling it a breach of treaties, little better than piracy, and such as it was neither expedient nor decent for a trading nation to encourage.\n",
      "during this interval, drake must have felt his situation unpleasant and precarious; but the queen turned the scale in his favor by going, april 4, 1581, to dine on board his ship at deptford, on which occasion she decl ---- d her entire approbation of his conduct, and conferred on him the honor, and such it then was, of knighthood.\n",
      "h ----  ship she ordered to be preserved as a monument of his glory.\n",
      "having fallen to decay, it  ----  at length broken up: a chair, made out of its planks, was presented to the university of oxford, and probably is still to be seen in the bodleian library.\n",
      "[illustration: the admiral of the span ---- h armada surrenders to drake.]\n",
      "drake had now established his reputation as the first se ---- an of the day; and in 1585 the queen, having resolved on war, intrusted him with the command of an expedition against the spanish colonies.\n",
      "he burnt or put to ransom the cities of st. jago, near cape verde, st. domingo, carthagena, and others, and returned to england, having fully ans ---- d the high expectations which were entertained of him.\n",
      "he was again employed with a larger force of thirty ships, in 1587, with which he entered the port of cadiz, burnt ten thousand tons of shipping, which  ----  to form part of the armada, took the castle of cape st. vincent, and sailing to the azores, made prize of a large and wealthy ship on its way from the indies.\n",
      "still more eminent were his services against the armada in the following year, in which he served as vice-admiral under lord howard of effingh ---- .\n",
      "but these  ----  well-known passages of history, and we have shortened our account of them, to relate at more length the early incidents of drake's adventurous life.\n",
      "in 1589 sir francis drake and sir john norris  ----  joined in the command of an expedition, meant to deliver portugal from the dominion of spain.\n",
      "this failed, as many expeditions have done in which the sea and land services were meant to act together; and as usual, each party threw the bl ---- e on the other.\n",
      "drake's plan appears to have been most judicious: it  ----  at least accordant with his character, downright and daring.\n",
      "he wished to sail straight for lisbon and surprise the place; but norris  ----  bent on landing at corunna, where he did indeed some harm to the spaniards, but no service toward the real objects of the expedition.\n",
      "when the land forces did at last besiege lisbon, drake was unwilling or unable to force his way up the tagus to co-operate with them, and for this he was afterward warmly bl ---- ed by norris.\n",
      "he defended himself by stating that the time m ---- spent by the english at corunna, had been well employed by the spaniards in fortifying lisbon; and we fully believe that neither fear nor jealousy would have made him hesitate at anything which he thought to be for the good of the service.\n",
      "this miscarriage, though for a time it cast something of a cloud upon drake's f ---- e, did not prevent his being again employed in 1595, when the queen, at the suggestion of himself and sir john hawkins, determined to send out another expedition against spanish america, under those two eminent navigators, the expenses of which were in great part to be defrayed by themselves and their friends.\n",
      "great hope  ----  naturally conceived of this expedition, the largest which had yet been sent against that quarter, for it consisted of thirty vessels and 2,500 men.\n",
      "the chief object was to sail to nombre de dios, march to pan ---- a, and there seize the treasure from peru.\n",
      "but the blow, which should have been struck immediately, was delayed by a feint on the part of the spaniards to invade england; the plate fleet arrived in safety, and the spanish colonies  ----  forewarned.\n",
      "hawkins died, it was said of grief at the ruined prospects of the expedition, november 12th, while the fleet lay before porto rico; and on the s ---- e evening drake had a narrow escape from a cannon-ball, which carried the stool from under him as he sat at supper and killed two of his chief officers.\n",
      "repulsed from porto rico, the admiral steered for the spanish main, where he burnt several towns, and  ---- ong them nombre de dios.\n",
      "he then sent a strong detachment of 750 men against pan ---- a; but they found the capture of that city impracticable.\n",
      "soon afterward he fell sick of a fever, and died january 28, 1596. h ----  death, like that of his coadjutor, is attributed to mental distress, and nothing is more probable than that disappointment may have made that noxious climate more deadly.\n",
      "hints of poisoning  ----  thrown out, but this is a surmise easily and often lightly made.\n",
      "\"thus,\" says fuller, in h ----  \"holy state,\" \"an extempore performance, scarce heard to be begun before we hear it is ended, comes off with better applause, or miscarries with less disgrace, than a long-studied and openly premeditated action.\n",
      " ---- sides, we see how great spirits, having mounted up to the highest pitch of performance, afterward strain and break their credits in trying to go beyond it.\n",
      "we will not justify all the actions of any man, though of a t ---- er profession than a sea-captain, in whom civility is often counted preciseness.\n",
      "for the main, we say that this our captain was a religious man toward god, and his houses, generally speaking, churches, where he c ---- e chaste in his life, just in his dealings, true of his word, and merciful to those that were under him, hating nothing so much as idleness.\"\n",
      "to these good qualities we may add that he  ----  kind and considerate to his sailors, though strict in the maintenance of discipline; and liberal on fit occasions, though a strict economist.\n",
      "he cut a water-course from buckland abbey to plymouth, a distance of seven miles in a straight line, and thirty by the windings of the conduit, to supply the latter town with fresh water, which before  ----  not to be procured within the distance of a mile.\n",
      "he is honorably distinguished from the atrocious race of buccaneers, to whom his ex ---- ple in some sort gave rise, by the humanity with which he treated his prisoners.\n",
      "and it should be mentioned, as a proof of his judicious benevolence, that in conjunction with sir john hawkins, he procured the establishment of the chest at chath ----  for the relief of aged or sick seamen, out of their own voluntary contributions.\n",
      "the faults ascribed to him are  ---- bition, inconstancy in friendship, and too much desire of popularity.\n",
      "in person drake  ----  low, but strongly made, \"well favoured, fayre, and of a cheerefull countenance.\"\n",
      "he left no issue: his nephew was created a baronet by j ---- es i., and the title is still extant.\n",
      "sir walter raleigh (1552-1618) very little  ----  known concerning the youth of sir walter raleigh.\n",
      "he was a younger son, descended of an ancient f ---- ily, and was born at a farm called hayes, near the mouth of the river otter, in devonshire, in the year 1552. he went to oriel college, oxford, at an early age, and gained high praise for the quickness and precocity of his talents.\n",
      "in 1569 he began his military c ---- er in the civil wars of france, as a volunteer in the protestant cause.\n",
      "it  ----  conjectured that he remained in france for more than six years, and returned to england in 1576. soon after he repaired to the netherlands, and served as a volunteer against the spaniards.\n",
      "in such schools, and under such leaders as coligni and the prince of orange, raleigh's natural aptitude for political and military science received the best nurture; but he  ----  soon drawn from the war in holland by a pursuit which had captivated his imagination from an early age--the prosecution of discovery in the new world.\n",
      "in conjunction with his half-brother, sir humphrey gilbert, a man of courage and ability, and a skilful sailor, he made an unsuccessful attempt to establish a colony in north  ---- erica.\n",
      "returning home in 1579, he immediately entered the queen's army in ireland, and served with good esteem for personal courage and professional skill, until the suppression of the re ---- llion in that country.\n",
      "he owed his introduction to court, and the personal favor of elizabeth, as is traditionally reported, to a fortunate and well-improved accident, which is too f ---- iliar to need repetition here.\n",
      "it is probable, however, that his n ---- e and talents were not unknown, for we find him employed almost immediately in certain matters of diplomacy.\n",
      "[tn]]  ---- ong the cares and pleasures of a courtier's life, raleigh preserved his zeal for american discovery.\n",
      "he applied his own resources to the fitting out of another expedition in 1583, under command of sir humphrey gilbert, which proved more unfortunate than the former one; two out of five vessels returned home in consequence of sickness, and two were wrecked, including that in which the admiral sailed; and the only result of the enterprise was the taking possession of newfoundland in the n ---- e of england.\n",
      "still raleigh's desire for  ---- erican adventure was not damped.\n",
      "the continent northward of the gulf of florida  ----  at this time unknown.\n",
      "but raleigh, upon careful study of the best authorities, had concluded that there was good reason for believing that a considerable tract of land did exist in that quarter; and with the assent of the queen in council, from whom he obtained letters patent, granting to himself and his heirs, under certain reservations, property in such countries as he should discover, with a right to provide for their protection and administration, he fitted out two ships, which sailed in april, 1584. the first land which they made was an island n ---- ed okakoke, running parallel to the coast of north carolina.\n",
      "they  ----  well received by the natives, and returned to england in the following autumn, highly pleased.\n",
      "nor  ----  less satisfaction felt by raleigh, or even by the queen, who conferred on him the honor of knighthood, a title which was then in high esteem, inasmuch as it was bestowed by that wise princess with a most frugal and just discrimination.\n",
      "she also gave him a very lucrative mark of favor, in the shape of a patent for licensing the selling of wine throughout the kingdom; and she directed that the new country, in allusion to herself, should  ----  called virginia.\n",
      "raleigh did not think it politic, perhaps  ----  not allowed, to quit the court to take charge in person of his undertaking; and those to whom he entrusted the difficult task of directing the infant colony, appear to have been unequal to their office.\n",
      "it is not necessary to pursue the history of an enterprise which proved unsuccessful, and in which sir walter personally bore no sh ---- .\n",
      "he showed h ----  earnestness by fitting out several expeditions, which must have been a heavy drain upon his fortune.\n",
      "but he is said to have derived immense wealth from prizes captured from the spaniards; and we may here observe that the lavish magnificence in dress, especially in jewels, for which raleigh  ----  remarkable, even in the gorgeous court of elizabeth (his state dress is said to have been enriched with jewels to the value of £60,000), may be considered less as an extravagance, than as a safe and portable investment of treasure.\n",
      "he possessed a large estate, granted out of forfeited lands in ireland; but this  ----  always a source rather of expense than of profit, until, in 1601, he sold it to the earl of cork.\n",
      "he was seneschal of the duchies of cornwall and exeter, and held the wardenship of the stannaries; and in 1586, as well as formerly in 1584, we find that he possessed a seat in parli ---- ent.\n",
      "in 1587, the formidable preparation of the span ---- h armada withdrew the mind of raleigh, as of all englishmen, from objects of minor importance, to the defence of their country.\n",
      "he was a member of the council of war directed to prepare a general scheme of defence, and held the office of lieutenant-general of cornwall, in addition to the charge of the isle of portland; but as on this occasion he possessed no naval command, he was not actively engaged in the destruction of that mighty arm ---- ent.\n",
      "in 1589 he served as a volunteer in the expedition of norr ----  and drake to portugal, of which some account has been given in the life of the latter.\n",
      "nor  ----  his labors unrewarded even in that unfortunate enterprise; for he captured several prizes, and received the present of a gold chain from the queen, in testimony of her approbation of his conduct.\n",
      "soon after these events, raleigh retired to h ----  irish property, being driven from court, according to some authorities, by the enmity of the earl of essex, then a young man just rising into favor.\n",
      "he there renewed a former intimacy with the poet spenser, who, like himself, had  ----  rewarded with a grant of land out of forfeited estates, and then resided at kilcolman castle.\n",
      "spenser has celebrated the return of h ----  friend in the beautiful pastoral, \"colin clout's come home again;\" and in that, and various passages of his works, has made honorable mention of the highly poetic spirit which enabled the \"shepherd of the ocean,\" as he is there denominated, to appreciate the merit of the \"fairy queen,\" and led him to promote the publication of it by every means in his power.\n",
      "the loss of raleigh's court-favor, if such there  ---- , could not have been of long duration on this occasion but he incurred more serious displeasure in consequence of a private marriage contracted with elizabeth throgmorton, one of the queen's maids of honor, a lady of beauty and accomplishments, who proved her worth and fidelity in the long train of misfortunes which beset the latter years of raleigh's life.\n",
      "in consequence of this intrigue, he  ----  committed to the tower.\n",
      "one or two  ---- using anecdotes are related of the devices which he employed to obtain forgiveness, by working on that vanity which was the queen's chief foible.\n",
      "he succeeded in appeasing his indignant mistress so far as to procure his release; and about the s ---- e time, in 1594, she granted to him the valuable manor of sherborne, in dorsetshire; but though she requited his services, she still forbade his appearance at court, where he now held the office of captain of the yeomen of the guard.\n",
      "raleigh  ----  peculiarly fitted to adorn a court by his imposing person, the graceful magnificence of his taste and habits, the elegance of his manners, and the interest of his conversation.\n",
      "these accomplishments  ----  sure passports to the favor of elizabeth; and he improved to the utmost the constant opportunities of intercourse with her which his post afforded, insomuch that, except the earls of leicester and essex, no one ever seems to have stood higher in her graces.\n",
      "but elizabeth's jealousy on the subject of her favorites' marriages is well known, and her anger  ----  lasting, in proportion to the value which she set on the incense of raleigh's flattery.\n",
      "he retired, on h ----  disgrace, to his new estate, in the improvement and embellishment of which he felt great interest.\n",
      "but though deeply alive to the beauties of nature, he had been too long trained to a life of  ---- bition and adventure to rest contented in the tranquil routine of a country life; and during this period of seclusion he again turned his thoughts to his favorite subject of american adventure, and laid the scheme of his first expedition to guiana, in search of the celebrated el dorado, the fabled seat of inexhaustible wealth.\n",
      "having fitted out, with the ass ---- tance of other private persons, a considerable fleet, raleigh sailed from plymouth, february 6, 1595. he left his ships in the mouth of the river orinoco, and sailed 400 miles into the interior in boats.\n",
      "it is to be recorded to his honor, that he treated the indians with great kindness; which, contrasted with the savage conduct of the spaniards, raised so friendly a feeling toward him, that for years his return  ----  eagerly expected, and at length was hailed with delight.\n",
      "the hardships of the undertaking, and the natural advantages of the country which he explored,  ----  eloquently described in his own account of the \"discovery of guiana.\"\n",
      "but the setting in of the rainy season rendered it necessary to return, without having reached the prom ---- ed land of wealth; and raleigh reaped no other fruit of his adventure than a certain quantity of geographical knowledge, and a full conviction of the importance of colonizing and taking possession of the newly discovered region.\n",
      "this continued through life to be his favorite scheme; but neither elizabeth nor her successor could be induced to view it in the s ---- e favorable light.\n",
      "on reaching england, he found the queen still unappeased; nor was he suffered to appear at court, and he complains in pathetic terms of the cold return with which his perils and losses  ----  requited.\n",
      "but he  ----  invested with a high command in the expedition of 1596, by which the spanish fleet was destroyed in the harbor of cadiz; and to his judgment and temper in overruling the faulty schemes proposed by others, the success of that enterprise was chiefly due.\n",
      "indeed, his services  ----  perhaps too important, and too justly appreciated by the public, for his own interests; for the great and general praise bestowed on him on this occasion tended to confirm a jealousy of long standing on the part of the commander-in-chief, the earl of essex; and it was probably owing to that favorite's influence that raleigh was still forbidden the queen's presence.\n",
      "essex, and the secretary of state, sir robert cecil, regarded each other with mutual d ---- trust and dislike.\n",
      "cecil and raleigh  ----  connected by ties of common interest, and, as the latter supposed, of friendship.\n",
      "still raleigh found the interest of the minister too weak to serve his purpose, while the interest of the favorite  ----  employed against him; and, as the only method of effecting his own restoration to the queen's favor, he undertook to work a reconciliation between these two powerful rivals.\n",
      "in this he succeeded, to the great admiration of all spectators; and the fruit of his policy  ----  seen in his re-admission to the execution of his official duties at court, june 1, 1597. in the following august he was appointed rear admiral in the expedition called the island voyage, of which essex held the chief command.\n",
      "the slight successes which  ----  obtained were again due to the military talents of raleigh; the main objects of the voyage were lost through the earl's inexperience.\n",
      "from th ----  time to the death of the queen, raleigh enjoyed an uninterrupted course of favor.\n",
      "elizabeth  ----  now old; cecil took no steps to diminish the high esteem in which she held sir walter raleigh, but he secretly labored to prejudice her successor against him, and he succeeded to his wish.\n",
      "very soon after the accession of j ---- es i., raleigh's post of captain of the guard was taken from him; and his patent of wines was revoked, though not without a nominal compensation being made.\n",
      "to complete his ruin, it  ----  contrived to involve him in a charge of treason.\n",
      "most writers have concurred in speaking of th ----  passage of history as inexplicable; it is the opinion of the last historian of raleigh, mr. tytler, that he has found sufficient evidence for regarding the whole plot as a device of cecil, and he has supported this opinion by cogent arguments.\n",

      "this charge cobh ----  retracted, confirmed, and retracted again, behaving in so equivocal a manner, that no reliance whatever can be placed on any of his assertions.\n",
      "but as the king was afraid of raleigh as much as the secretary hated him, this vague charge, unsupported by other evidence, was made sufficient to commit him to the tower; and, after being plied with private ex ---- inations, in which nothing criminal could be elicited, he was brought to trial, november 17, 1603. for an account of that memorable scene we shall refer to mr. jardine's \"criminal trials,\" vol.\n",
      "i. it  ----  reported to have been said by one of the judges who presided over it, on his death-bed, that \"the justice of england had never been so degraded and injured as by the condemnation of sir walter raleigh.\"\n",
      "the behavior of the victim himself  ----  the object of universal admiration, for the tempered mixture of patience and noble spirit with which he bore the oppressive measure dealt to him.\n",
      "he had before been unpopular; but it  ----  recorded by an eye-witness that \"he behaved himself so worthily, so wisely, and so temperately, that in half a day the mind of all the company was changed from the extremest hate to the extremest pity.\"\n",
      "the sentence of death thus unfairly and disgracefully obtained  ----  not immediately carried into execution.\n",
      "j ---- es was not satisfied with the evidence adduced on the trial; and believing at the same time that raleigh had been plotting against him, he set his royal wit to dive into the mystery.\n",
      "of the singular scene which the british solomon devised it is not necessary to speak, since raleigh  ----  not an actor in it.\n",
      "but as no more evidence could be obtained against him, even by the king's sagacity, he was reprieved, and remanded to the tower, where the next twelve years of his life  ----  spent in confinement.\n",
      "fortunately, he had never ceased to cultivate literature with a zeal not often found in the soldier and politician, and he now beguiled the tedium of h ----  lot by an entire devotion to those studies which before had only served to diversify his more active and engrossing pursuits.\n",
      "of his poetical talents we have already made short mention; to the end of life he continued the practice of pouring out his mind in verse, and there  ----  several well-known and beautiful pieces expressive of his feelings in prison, and in the anticipation of immediate death; especially \"the lie,\" and the beautiful little poem called \"the pilgrimage.\"\n",
      "he also possessed a strong turn for mathematics, and studied them with much success in the society and under the guidance of h ----  friend, thomas hariot, one of the most accomplished mathematicians of the age.\n",
      "chemistry  ----  another favorite pursuit, in which, according to the standard of his contemporaries, he made great progress.\n",
      "but the most important occupation of his imprisonment  ----  the composition of the \"history of the world.\"\n",
      "raleigh meant to bring it down to modern times; but the untimely death of henry, prince of wales, for whose use it  ----  composed, deprived him of the spirit to proceed with so laborious an undertaking.\n",
      "several d ---- courses on these topics, addressed to the prince, will be found in the editions of raleigh's works.\n",
      "henry repaid these services with sincere friendship and admiration; and we may presume that h ----  adviser looked forward to that friendship, not only for a cessation of misfortune, but for a more brilliant period of favor and power than he had yet enjoyed.\n",
      "fortunately, however, his patron's death was preceded by that of his arch-enemy, cecil; and through the mediation of the duke of buckingh ---- , raleigh was released from the tower in march, 1615; and obtained permission to follow up his long-cherished scheme of establishing a colony in guiana, and working a gold mine, of which he had ascertained the existence and situation.\n",
      "the results of th ----  disastrous voyage must be shortly given.\n",
      "raleigh sailed march 28, 1617, and reached the coast of guiana in novem ---- r following.\n",
      "being himself d ---- abled by sickness from proceeding farther, he despatched a party to the mine under the command of captain keymis, an officer who had served in the former voyage to guiana.\n",
      "but during the interval which had elapsed since raleigh's first d ---- covery of that country, the spaniards had extended their settlements into it, and in particular had built a town called santa thome in the immediate neighborhood of the mine in question.\n",
      "j ---- es, with his usual duplicity, while he authorized the expedition, revealed every particular connected with it to the spanish ambassador.\n",
      "the english, therefore,  ----  expected in the orinoco, and preparation had been made for repelling them by force.\n",
      "keymis and his men  ----  unexpectedly attacked by the garrison of santa thome, and a sharp contest ensued, in which the english gained the advantage, and burnt the town.\n",
      "in this action raleigh's eldest son  ----  killed.\n",
      "the spaniards still occupied the passes to the mine, and after an unsuccessful attempt to d ---- lodge them, keymis abandoned the enterprise and returned to the ships.\n",
      "raleigh's correspondence expresses in affecting terms h ----  grief and indignation at this double misfortune: the loss of a brave and promising son, and the destruction of the hopes which he had founded on this long-cherished adventure.\n",
      "on h ----  return to england, he found himself marked out for a victim to appease the resentment of the spanish court, to which he had long been an object of fear and hatred.\n",
      "h ----  conduct abroad had already been closely scrutinized, in the hope of finding some act of piracy, or unauthorized aggression against spain, for which he might be brought to trial.\n",
      "both these hopes failing, and his death, in compliment to spain, being resolved on, it  ----  determined to carry into effect the sentence passed fifteen years before, from which he had never been legally released; and a warrant was accordingly issued to the judges, requiring them to order execution.\n",
      "he ins ---- ted on the nature of his late commission, and on that plea being overruled, submitted with his usual calmness and dignity.\n",

      "three hundred years ago the house of standish  ----  a notable one in england.\n",
      "the f ---- ily had numerous possessions; their lancashire estate of duxbury hall, in the shadow of rivington pike and the pennine hills, was pleasant and extensive, and there they had lived for generations, as there they live to-day.\n",
      "of this lancashire home was that john standish, \"squire to the king,\" who killed wat tyler, the agitator, on that memorable june day of 1381 when the boy-king of england, richard the second, so pluckily faced his rebellious subjects on the plain of smithfield; of it was that sir john standish who fought under the leopard-banner of king edward at the stone mill of crécy; and of it was that gallant soldier miles standish, the puritan captain, the first commissioned military officer of new england, f ---- ous in american history, song, and story, as the stay and bulwark of the pilgrims of plymouth in their days of struggle and beginning.\n",
      "miles standish (or myles, as the old spelling has it) was born in lancashire, presumably in the f ---- ily manor house of duxbury hall, in the year 1584. the story of his life is simple.\n",
      "the absolute facts upon which it is based are meagre, but enough is known to warrant the assertion that miles standish was heir to the n ---- e and estates of the standishes of lancashire, from which, by some device not on record, he was, as he sturdily maintained in his will, \"surreptitiously\" defrauded.\n",
      "at the beginning of the seventeenth century the provinces of the netherlands  ----  battling for life against the tyranny of spain.\n",
      "the protestant eliza ---- th of england gave help and support to the protestant stadtholder maurice, and many of her fighting men carried pike or arquebus at the sack of cadiz, fought at nieuport and ostend, or served the guns in the great sea-fight off gibraltar that, in 1607, broke the power of spain.\n",
      " ---- ong these fighting-men was young miles standish, and he fought so stoutly and to such good purpose that, before he was twenty-one he had attained the rank and title of captain, and was known to englishmen in the low countries as a brave and gallant soldier.\n",
      "in 1609 c ---- e the twelve years' truce between tired spain and not less wearied holland, that gave way in 1621 to the stubborn and bloody thirty years' war.\n",
      "it  ---- , probably, in the early years of this truce that captain miles standish, a born fighter, went back to england to battle for his heritage.\n",
      "not being the match for the law men in england that he  ----  for spanish dons in holland, he was forced to retire from the unequal contest, defeated but not conquered.\n",
      "this belief in his rights to the inheritance of the standishes he sturdily maintained to the last; for, dying forty years after in the new land his sword had helped to conquer and his wisdom to found, he left by his last will and test ---- ent unto his son and heir, alexander: \"ormistic, bonsconge, wrightington, maudeslay, and the estates in the isle of man\"--none of which he nor his descendants were ever to occupy or hold.\n",
      "it was after this unsuccessful struggle for his heritage that he crossed again to holland and, from some cause not apparent--perhaps his disgust at english law, perhaps the attractions of one who, later, bec ---- e mistress rose standish, may supply the motive--settled among the self-exiled english folk in leyden who, because of religious differences with the established church, had left their english homes and, calling themselves pilgrims because of their wanderings, had made a settlement in the dutch city of leyden, \"fair and beautiful and of a sweet situation.\"\n",
      "although not of the religious faith and following of the pilgrims of leyden--indeed the story runs that the fiery little captain had been, at one time, a romanist--he must have been settled  ---- ong them for years, for, on the eve of their emigration to america, we find him as one of their leaders, accepted and commissioned as the military adviser of the colonists.\n",
      "the time of his life in leyden  ----  one of religious unrest in europe; and in holland, during that twelve years' truce with spain, the theological disputes between calvinists and arminians ran so high as to bring john of barneald to the scaffold, and to drive grotius the scholar into exile.\n",
      "these days of stern d ---- pute may have had their influence on the sturdy english soldier living in the midst of dutch life and dutch disputations, and made him lean to the side of puritanism, even if never openly avowing it as his religious faith.\n",
      "it is, indeed, a singular fact that the mainstay and chief protector of the first puritan colonists of  ---- erica was neither of their communion nor of their connection, and is openly censured by puritan writers as one who, so says hubbard, \"had been a soldier in the low countries and had never entered the school of our saviour christ or of john the baptist.\"\n",
      "but h ----  companions and associates seem not to have permitted the dissociation to have had special weight with them.\n",
      "they gladly welcomed captain standish and his wife, rose,  ---- ong the little company of exiles that set out from delft haven for virginia, and gave their names place on that memorable passenger list of the little schooner mayflower, which, leaving the harbor of old plymouth, in england, in september, 1620, finally dropped anchor in the harbor of new plymouth, in new england, in december following.\n",
      "from the outset of this novel \"adventure\"--itself a turning-point in  ---- erican history--this soldier of fortune was given place and prominence in the councils of a community which seems to have enlisted his support, not so much on its religious as on its adventurous side; and to this \"dissenter from dissent\" was intrusted the defence of a company of religious enthusiasts, sailing upon what they deemed a divine mission, only in the practical side of which did their military adviser find occupation or interest.\n",
      "the up-bringing of miles stand ---- h had been such as to fit him for leadership, and this he assumed early in the history of the enterprise.\n",
      "even on the deck of the mayflower, he was recognized as one whose counsels were wise and whose actions were inspiring, and when in the cabin of the mayflower, in the harbor of provincetown, the f ---- ous compact was drawn up, said to be \"the first written constitution in the world,\" the bold signature of \"myles standish\" was the clearest of the forty-one pilgrim autographs that were affixed to that famous document.\n",
      "it  ----  captain standish who, with his sixteen \"well-armed men,\" made a thorough exploration of the provincetown peninsula; he organized and headed the party of observation which, later, sailed the shallop and marched with watchful eyes along the shores of cape cod, seeking the best place for settlement; and, on december 6th following, he sailed with a picked party across massachusetts bay and, in much peril and with many adventures, spied out the land and determined upon the harbor of plymouth as the best spot for permanent settlement.\n",
      "it was to captain standish's knowledge as to the best locations and to his skill as a surveyor, that the colonists were indebted for the selection of their town site and the laying-out of their town; as, later, the s ---- e skill came in play when were laid out the new towns that followed after the plymouth beginnings.\n",
      "through all that dreary and dreadful first winter, when half their number died, captain standish  ----  their mainstay, as one whose word was ever reassuring and whose arm was as ready for protection as was his brain for planning methods of defence.\n",
      "though his wife, mistress rose standish,  ----  one of the early victims of that bitter winter of death, his courage never faltered, his vigilance never slackened.\n",
      "and when, in the midst of all the peril and suffering, in february, 1621, miles standish was appointed military captain of the colony, confidence was restored and courage renewed in the bosoms of that suffering but heroic and indomitable band; so that when spring c ---- e and the mayflower sailed for england, not one of the settlers returned in her, nor would desert the cause to which they had pledged themselves.\n",
      "it  ----  customary to credit the final success of the pilgrims of plymouth to the religious element that held sway over them, making them patient, persistent, uncompromising, faithful, and earnest.\n",
      "but the w ---- dom of carver, the genius of bradford, the fervor of brewster, the zeal of winslow, would have been of small avail had they not been backed by the decision, the resolution, the courage, the constancy, and the forethought of their brave captain, miles standish, \"the john smith of new england\" as he has been called, the man of helpful measures and of iron nerves, who could \"hew down forests and live on crumbs.\"\n",
      "from first to last he  ----  the loyal supporter and trusty defender of the plymouth colony.\n",
      "how happy a thing had it been, if you had converted some before you had killed any.... let me be bold to exhort you seriously to consider of the d ---- position of your captain, whom i love.\n",
      "there  ----  cause to fear that by occasion, especially of provocation, there may be wanting (in him) that tenderness of the life of man which is meet.\"\n",
      "but the pilgrims of plymouth seem not to have questioned the dec ---- ive measures of the man who knew when and how to act in their defence.\n",
      "alone he faced the roystering morton at merrymount, unarming that vaporing rebel and putting h ----  riotous colony upon its good behavior.\n",
      "he led out the forty men of plymouth enlisted for the pequot war, headed the expedition that in 1635, sailed against the encroaching french in penobscot bay, and, as late as 1653, when \"very auncient and full of dolorous paines,\" expressed himself as ready to take the command intrusted to him when the colony forces  ----  about to enter upon a struggle for the right of occupation of the connecticut country with the dutch colonists of manhattan.\n",
      "he never refused any burden however heavy nor shirked any duty however onerous; he cheerfully yielded obedience to the civil power, never exceeding h ----  orders, nor rashly assuming responsibilities, nor leading his men upon unwise ventures.\n",
      "while always the military commander of the colony, his counsel and help  ----  counted as equally valuable in matters of administration.\n",
      "he served repeatedly as one of the governor's council; he  ----  at one time assistant-governor or deputy, and, from 1644 to 1649, was treasurer of the plymouth colony.\n",
      "he went to england as the envoy of the colonists in 1625, and in the midst of plague, of evil times and of bitter jealousies, withstood the tyranny of the london traders who owned the pilgrims' labor; and braving both heavy debt and the possibility of censure, bought out the traders' rights in the n ---- e of his associates.\n",
      "the personal descriptions of th ----  remarkable man that have come down to us, show him as a man of small stature, quick-tempered, choleric, sturdy and bluff.\n",
      "\"as a little chimney is soon fired,\" wrote the puritan historian hubbard, \"so  ----  the plymouth captain, a man of very little stature, yet of a very hot and angry temper.\"\n",
      "and yet his relations with such men as the noble bradford, the bl ---- eless brewster, the politic winslow, were so close and of so personal a character that one can hardly accept unquestioningly the story of his hot and unreasoning temper.\n",
      "he  ----  a soldier and a fighter; but he loved peace and quiet, and his life was full of friendly offices and of kindly deeds.\n",
      "on nantasket beach he built the first \"house of refuge\" and life-saving station in  ---- erica.\n",
      "he was a gentle nurse in the winter of sickness, a friend and adviser to those in trouble or distress, a loving father in the days when parents were not unfrequently tyrants, and a forgiving spirit, as the old story of his f ---- ous \"courtship\" (with sufficient foundation to warrant its acceptance) amply proves.\n",
      "the commun ---- m of the early pilgrim days gave place in time to personal possession and, as the colony grew, certain of those who had been leaders desired more extended holdings.\n",
      "captain standish was one of these, and despite his friend bradford's protests, he moved across the bay and in 1632 occupied a large and fertile stretch north of plymouth, to which, still clinging to his old claim of a stolen heritage, he gave the n ---- e of duxbury.\n",
      "here in the midst of peaceful pursuits, but ever ready to o ---- y the colony's call for counsel or for leadership, he lived for over twenty years, dying october 3, 1656, at the age of seventy-two.\n",
      "a notable figure in  ---- erican history, miles standish is a type of that mingled spirit of adventure, liberty, and distrust that impelled emigration across the sea and, combined with the uncompromising stand for freedom of conscience, founded and up-built the pilgrim colony of plymouth.\n",
      "his existence  ---- ong these pilgrims is in itself an anomaly.\n",
      "but it  ----  one of those strange associations and unfaltering friendships that have left their mark for good upon the world since the days when the roman fighting-man stood stanchly by the side of the christian proselyte even to the death.\n",
      "tradition says that miles standish  ----  buried between two pointed stones in the graveyard of south duxbury, but the question of his burial-place is still unsettled.\n",
      "the tall shaft, rising from the crest of captain's hill in duxbury, and surmounted with a statue of the f ---- ous colonial captain, fitly commemorates a life that has won a place in the american heart that only grows stronger and more enduring as time goes on.\n",
      "[tn]] the declaration of the great founder of christianity that he \"c ---- e not to bring peace, but a sword,\" receives its completest justification in the history of europe during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\n",

      "at the age of eight his father gave him a rifle of his own, and at twelve, with either a \"gun\" or a winchester, he  ----  an expert.\n",
      "he taught himself to use a weapon either in h ----  left or right hand and to shoot, indian fashion, hanging by one leg from his pony and using it as a cover, and to turn in the saddle and shoot behind him.\n",

      "and in 1893, when burnh ----  and his brother-in-law, ingram, started for south africa, mrs. burnham went with them, and in every part of south africa shared her husband's life of travel and danger.\n",

      "but as in rhodesia the first matabele uprising had broken out, he continued on down the coast, and volunteered for that c ---- paign.\n",
      "this  ----  the real beginning of his fortunes.\n",
      "the \"war\" was not unlike the indian fighting of his early days, and although the country was new to him, with the kind of warfare then being waged between the kaffirs under king lobengula and the white settlers of the british south africa company, the chartered company of cecil rhodes, he was intimately f ---- iliar.\n",
      "it does not take big men long to recognize other big men, and burnh ---- 's remarkable work as a scout at once brought him to the notice of rhodes and dr. jameson, who was personally conducting the campaign.\n",
      "the war was their own private war, and to them, at such a crisis in the history of their settlement, a man like burnh ----  was invaluable.\n",
      "the chief incident of this c ---- paign, the fame of which rang over all great britain and her colonies, was the gallant but hopeless stand made by major alan wilson and his patrol of thirty-four men.\n",
      "it was burnh ---- 's attempt to save these men that made him known from buluwayo to cape town.\n",
      "king lobengula and his warriors  ----  halted on one bank of the shangani river, and on the other major forbes, with a picked force of three hundred men, was coming up in pursuit.\n",

      "at nightfall major wilson and a patrol of twelve men, with burnh ----  and his brother-in-law, ingram, acting as scouts, were ordered to make a dash into the camp of lobengula and, if possible, in the confusion of their sudden attack, and under cover of a terrific thunder-storm that was raging, bring him back a prisoner.\n",
      "with the king in their hands the white men  ---- lieved the rebellion would collapse.\n",
      "to the number of three thousand the matabeles were sleeping in a succession of c ---- ps, through which the fourteen men rode at a gallop.\n",
      "but in the darkness it was difficult to distinguish the trek wagon of the king, and by the time they found his laager the matabeles from the other c ---- ps through which they had ridden had given the alarm.\n",
      "at a distance of about seven hundred yards from the c ---- ps there was a giant ant-hill, and the patrol rode toward it.\n",
      "when the party drew rein at the ant-hill it was found that of the fourteen three  ----  missing.\n",
      "as the official scout of the patrol and the only one who could see in the dark, wilson ordered burnh ----  back to find them.\n",
      "burnh ----  said he could do so only by feeling the hoof-prints in the mud and that he would like some one with him to lead his pony.\n",
      "with his fingers burnh ----  followed the trail of the eleven horses to where, at right angles, the hoof-prints of the three others separated from it, and so came upon the three men.\n",
      "it was this feat that established his reputation  ---- ong british, boers, and black men in south africa.\n",
      "in the jungle about them, they could hear the enemy splashing through the mud, and the sw ---- hing sound of the branches as they swept back into place.\n",
      "it  ----  still raining.\n",
      "just before the dawn there c ---- e the sounds of voices and the welcome clatter of accoutrements.\n",
      "the men of the patrol, believing the column had joined them, sprang up rejoicing, but it  ----  only a second patrol, under captain borrow, who had been sent forward with twenty men as re-enforcements.\n",
      "they had come in time to sh ----  in a glorious immortality.\n",
      "no sooner had these men joined than the kaffirs began the attack; and the white men at once learned that they  ----  trapped in a complete circle of the enemy.\n",
      "hidden by the trees, the kaffirs fired point-blank, and in a very little time half of wilson's force  ----  killed or wounded.\n",
      "as the horses  ----  shot down the men used them for breastworks.\n",
      "there  ----  no other shelter.\n",

      "\"tell him to come up at once,\" he said; \"we  ----  nearly finished.\"\n",
      "he detailed a trooper n ---- ed gooding and ingram to accompany burnham.\n",
      "gooding was but lately out from london, and knew nothing of scouting, so burnh ----  and ingram warned him, whether he saw the reason for it or not, to act exactly as they did.\n",
      "the three men had b ---- ly left the others before the enemy sprang at them with their spears.\n",
      "in five minutes they  ----  being fired at from every bush.\n",
      "then followed a remarkable ride, in which burnh ----  called to his aid all he had learned in thirty years of border warfare.\n",
      "the enemy followed them to the very bank of the river, where, finding the \"drift\" covered with the swollen waters, they  ----  forced to swim.\n",
      "they reached the other bank only to find for ---- s hotly engaged with another force of the matabeles.\n",
      "\"i have been sent for re-enforcements,\" burnh ----  said to forbes, \"but i believe we are the only survivors of that party.\"\n",
      "forbes himself was too hard pressed to give help to wilson, and burnh ---- , his errand over, took his place in the column, and began firing upon the new enemy.\n",
      "six weeks later the bodies of wilson's patrol  ----  found lying in a circle.\n",
      "each of them had  ----  shot many times.\n",
      "a son of lobengula, who witnessed their extermination, and who in buluwayo had often heard the englishmen sing their national anthem, told how the five men who  ----  the last to die stood up and, swinging their hats defiantly, sang \"god save the queen.\"\n",
      "the incident will long be recorded in song and story; and in london was reproduced in two theatres, in each of which the man who played \"burnh ---- , the american scout,\" as he rode off for re-enforcements, was as loudly cheered by those in the audience as by those on the stage.\n",
      "hensman, in h ----  \"history of rhodesia,\" says: \"one hardly knows which to most admire, the men who went on this dangerous errand, through brush swarming with natives, or those who remained behind battling against overwhelming odds.\"\n",
      "for his help in this war the chartered company presented burnh ----  with the campaign medal, a gold watch engraved with words of appreciation; and at the suggestion of cecil rhodes gave him, ingram, and the hon.\n",
      "maurice clifford, jointly, a tract of land of three hundred squ ----  acres.\n",
      "after this c ---- paign burnham led an expedition of ten white men and seventy kaffirs north of the zambesi river to explore barotzeland and other regions to the north of mashonaland, and to establish the boundaries of the concession given him, ingram, and clifford.\n",
      "in order to protect burnh ----  on the march the chartered company signed a treaty with the native king of the country through which he wished to travel, by which the king gave him permission to pass freely and guaranteed him against attack.\n",
      "but latea, the son of the king, refused to recognize the treaty and sent his young men in great numbers to surround burnh ---- 's camp.\n",
      "burnh ----  had been instructed to avoid a fight, and was torn between his desire to obey the chartered company and to prevent a massacre.\n",
      "as soon as night fell, with only three companions and a missionary to act as a witness of what occurred, he slipped through the lines of latea's men, and, kicking down the fence around the prince's hut, suddenly appe ---- d before him and covered him with his rifle.\n",
      "\" ----  it peace or war?\"\n",
      "burnh ----  asked.\n",
      "we may all  ----  killed, but you will be the first to die.\"\n",
      "the m ---- sionary also spoke urging latea to abide by the treaty.\n",
      "burnh ----  says the prince seemed much more impressed by the arguments of the missionary than by the fact that he still was covered by burnham's rifle.\n",
      "whichever argument moved him, he called off h ----  warriors.\n",
      "on this expedition burnh ----  discovered the ruins of great granite structures fifteen feet wide, and made entirely without mortar.\n",
      "they  ----  of a period dating before the phoenicians.\n",
      "he also sought out the ruins described to him by f. c. selous, the f ---- ous hunter, and by rider haggard as king solomon's mines.\n",
      "much to the delight of mr. haggard, he brought back for him from the mines of his imagination real gold orn ---- ents and a real gold bar.\n",
      "on this s ---- e expedition, which lasted five months, burnham endured one of the severest hardships of his life.\n",
      "alone with ten kaffir boys, he started on a week's journey across the dried-up basin of what once had  ----  a great lake.\n",
      "water was carried in goat-skins on the heads of the be ---- rs.\n",
      "the boys, finding the bags an unwieldy burden, and believing, with the happy optimism of their race, that burnh ---- 's warnings were needless, and that at a stream they soon could refill the bags, emptied the water on the ground.\n",
      "the tortures that followed this wanton waste  ----  terrible.\n",
      "five of the boys died, and after several days, when burnh ----  found water in abundance, the tongues of the others were so swollen that their jaws could not meet.\n",
      "on this trip burnh ----  passed through a region ravaged by the \"sleeping sickness,\" where his nostrils were never free from the stench of dead bodies, where in some of the villages, as he expressed it, \"the hyenas were mangy with overeating, and the buzzards so gorged they could not move out of our way.\"\n",
      "from this expedition he brought back many orn ---- ents of gold manufactured before the christian era, and made several valuable maps of hitherto uncharted regions.\n",
      "it  ----  in recognition of the information gathered by him on this trip that he was elected a fellow of the royal geographical society.\n",
      "he returned to rhodesia in time to take part in the second mata ---- le rebellion.\n",
      "this was in 1896. by now burnh ----  was a very prominent member of the \"vortrekers\" and pioneers at buluwayo, and sir frederick carrington, who was in command of the forces, attached him to his staff.\n",
      "this second outbreak was a more serious uprising than the one of 1893, and as it was evident the forces of the chartered company could not handle it, imperial troops  ----  sent to assist them.\n",
      "had they done so, the cost of keeping them would have fallen on the chartered company, already a sufferer in pocket from the ravages of the rinderpest and the expenses of the investigation which followed the j ---- eson raid.\n",
      "it was suggested to him by a young colonial, n ---- ed armstrong, the commissioner of the district, that this could be done by destroying the \"god,\" or high priest, umlimo, who was the chief inspiration of the rebellion.\n",
      "th ----  high priest had incited the rebels to a general massacre of women and children, and had given them confidence by promising to strike the white soldiers blind and to turn their bullets into water.\n",
      "armstrong had discovered the secret hiding-place of umlimo, and carrington ordered burnh ----  to penetrate the enemy's lines, find the god, capture him, and if that were not possible to destroy him.\n",
      "the adventure  ----  a most desperate one.\n",
      "umlimo  ----  secreted in a cave on the top of a huge kopje.\n",
      "at the base of this was a village where  ----  gathered two regiments, of a thousand men each, of his fighting men.\n",
      "for miles around this village the country  ----  patrolled by roving bands of the enemy.\n",
      "against a white man reaching the cave and returning, the chances were a hundred to one, and the difficulties of the journey are illustrated by the fact that burnh ----  and armstrong were unable to move faster than at the rate of a mile an hour.\n",
      "when they reached the base of the kopje in which umlimo  ----  hiding, they concealed their ponies in a clump of bushes, and on hands and knees began the ascent.\n",
      "directly below them lay the village, so close that they could smell the odors of cooking from the huts, and hear, r ---- ing drowsily on the hot, noonday air, voices of the warriors.\n",
      "for minutes at a time they lay as motionless as the granite bowlders around or squirmed and crawled over loose stones which a m ---- s of hand or knee would have dislodged and sent clattering into the village.\n",
      "after an hour of th ----  tortuous climbing the cave suddenly opened before them, and they beheld umlimo.\n",
      "burnh ----  recognized that to take him alive from his stronghold was an impossibility, and that even they themselves would leave the place was equally doubtful.\n",
      "so, obeying orders, he fired, killing the man who had boasted he would turn the bullets of h ----  enemies into water.\n",
      "in an instant the veldt below was black with running men, and as, concealment being no longer possible, the white men rose to fly a great shout of anger told them they  ----  discovered.\n",
      "at the s ---- e moment two women, returning from a stream where they had gone for water, saw the ponies, and ran screaming to give the alarm.\n",
      "the race that followed lasted two hours, for so quickly did the kaffirs spread out on every side that it was impossible for burnh ----  to gain ground in any one direction, and he was forced to dodge, turn, and double.\n",
      "at one time the white men  ----  driven back to the very kopje from which the race had started.\n",
      "this exploit  ----  one of the chief factors in bringing the war to a close.\n",
      "the matabeles, finding their leader was only a mortal like themselves, and so could not, as he had promised, bring miracles to their aid, lost heart, and when cecil rhodes in person made overtures of peace, his terms  ----  accepted.\n",
      "during the hard days of the siege, when rations were few and bad, burnh ---- 's little girl, who had been the first white child born in buluwayo, died of fever and lack of proper food.\n",
      "th ----  with other causes led him to leave rhodesia and return to california.\n",
      "it  ----  possible he then thought he had forever turned his back on south africa, but, though he himself had departed, the impression he had made there remained behind him.\n",
      "burnh ----  did not rest long in california.\n",
      "in alaska the hunt for gold had just  ---- gun, and, the old restlessness seizing him, he left pasadena and her blue skies, tropical plants, and trolley-car strikes for the new raw land of the klondike.\n",
      "with burnh ----  it has always been the place that is being made, not the place in being, that attracts.\n",
      "as he once said: \"it  ----  the constructive side of frontier life that most appeals to me, the building up of a country, where you see the persistent drive and force of the white man; when the place is finally settled i don't seem to enjoy it very long.\"\n",
      "in mining in alaska he succeeded well, but against the country he holds a constant grudge,  ---- cause it kept him out of the fight with spain.\n",
      "when war was decl ---- d he was in the wilds and knew nothing of it, and though on his return to civilization he telegraphed colonel roosevelt volunteering for the rough riders, and at once started south, by the time he had reached seattle the war was over.\n",
      "several times has he spoken to me of how bitterly he regretted m ---- sing this chance to officially fight for his country.\n",
      "that he had twice served with engl ---- h forces made him the more keen to show his loyalty to his own people.\n",
      "that he would have been given a comm ---- sion in the rough riders seems evident from the opinion president roosevelt has publicly expressed of him.\n",
      "\"i know burnh ---- ,\" the president wrote in 1901.\n",
      "\"he  ----  a scout and a hunter of courage and ability, a man totally without fear, a sure shot, and a fighter.\n",
      "he  ----  the ideal scout, and when enlisted in the military service of any country he is bound to be of the greatest benefit.\"\n",
      "the truth of this burnh ----  was soon to prove.\n",
      "in 1899 he had returned to the klondike, and in january of 1900 had  ----  six months in skagway.\n",
      "in that s ---- e month lord roberts sailed for cape town to take command of the army, and with him on his staff was burnham's former commander, sir frederick, now lord, carrington.\n",
      "one night as the ship was in the bay of biscay, carrington was talking of burnh ----  and giving instances of his marvellous powers as a \"tracker.\"\n",
      "\"he  ----  the best scout we ever had in south africa!\"\n",
      "carrington decl ---- d.\n",
      "said ro ---- rts.\n",
      "what followed  ----  well known.\n",
      "from gibraltar a cable was sent to skagway, offering burnh ----  the position, created especially for him, of chief of scouts of the british army in the field.\n",
      "probably never before in the h ---- tory of wars has one nation paid so pleasant a tribute to the abilities of a man of another nation.\n",
      "the sequel  ----  interesting.\n",
      "the cablegr ----  reached skagway by the steamer _city of seattle_.\n",
      "the purser left it at the post-office, and until two hours and a half before the ste ---- er was listed to start on her return trip, there it lay.\n",
      "then burnh ---- , in asking for his mail, received it.\n",
      "in two hours and a half he had his f ---- ily, himself, and his belongings on board the steamer, and had started on his half-around-the-world journey from alaska to cape town.\n",
      "a skagway paper of january 5, 1900, published the day after burnh ----  sailed, throws a side light on his character.\n",
      "after telling of his hasty departure the day before, and of the high compliment that had been paid to \"a prominent skagwayan,\" it adds: \"although mr. burnh ----  has lived in skagway since last august, and has been north for many months, he has said little of his past, and few have known that he is the man famous over the world as 'the american scout' of the matabele wars.\"\n",
      "many a man who went to the klondike did not, for reasons best known to himself, talk about h ----  past.\n",
      "but it is characteristic of burnh ----  that, though he lived there two years, his associates did not know, until the british government snatched him from among them, that he had not always been a prospector like themselves.\n",
      "i was on the s ---- e ship that carried burnham the latter half of his journey, from southampton to cape town, and every night for seventeen nights was one of a group of men who shot questions at him.\n",
      "and it  ----  interesting to see a fellow-countryman one had heard praised so highly so completely make good.\n",
      "it  ----  not as though he had a credulous audience of commercial tourists.\n",
      " ---- ong the officers who each evening gathered around him were colonel gallilet of the egyptian cavalry, captain frazer commanding the scotch gillies, captain mackie of lord roberts's staff, each of whom was later killed in action; colonel sir charles hunter of the royal rifles, major bagot, major lord dudley, and captain lord valentia.\n",
      "each of these had either held command in border fights in india or the sudan or had hunted big g ---- e, and the questions each asked were the outcome of his own experience and observation.\n",
      "not for a single evening could a faker have submitted to the midnight ex ---- ination through which they put burnham and not have exposed his ignorance.\n",
      "they wanted to know what difference there is in a column of dust raised by cavalry and by trek wagons, how to tell whether a horse that has passed was going at a trot or a gallop, the way to throw a di ---- ond hitch, how to make a fire without at the same time making a target of yourself, how--why--what--and how?\n",
      "and what made us most admire burnh ----  was that when he did not know he at once said so.\n",
      "within two nights he had us so absolutely at h ----  mercy that we would have followed him anywhere; anything he chose to tell us, we would have accepted.\n",
      "we  ----  ready to believe in flying foxes, flying squirrels, that wild turkeys dance quadrilles--even that you must never sleep in the moonlight.\n",
      "had he demanded: \"do you believe in v ---- pires?\"\n",
      "to ask that a scout should on an ocean ste ---- er prove his ability was certainly placing him under a severe handicap.\n",
      "as one of the british officers said: \"it's about as fair a g ---- e as though we planted the captain of this ship in the sahara desert, and told him to prove he could run a ten-thousand-ton liner.\"\n",
      "burnh ----  continued with lord roberts to the fall of pretoria, when he was invalided home.\n",
      "during the advance north he  ----  a hundred times inside the boer laagers, keeping headquarters staff daily informed of the enemy's movements; was twice captured and twice escaped.\n",
      "he  ----  first captured while trying to warn the british from the fatal drift at thaba'nchu.\n",
      "when reconnoitring alone in the morning mist he c ---- e upon the boers hiding on the banks of the river, toward which the english were even then advancing.\n",
      "the boers  ----  moving all about him, and cut him off from his own side.\n",
      "he had to choose between abandoning the engl ---- h to the trap or signalling to them, and so exposing himself to capture.\n",
      "with the red kerchief the scouts carried for that purpose he wigwagged to the approaching soldiers to turn back, that the enemy  ----  awaiting them.\n",
      "but the column, which was without an advance guard, paid no attention to his signals and plodded steadily on into the  ---- bush, while burnham was at once made prisoner.\n",
      "in the fight that followed he pretended to receive a wound in the knee and bound it so elaborately that not even a surgeon would have disturbed the c ---- fully arranged bandages.\n",
      "limping heavily and groaning with pain, he was placed in a trek wagon with the officers who really  ----  wounded, and who, in consequence, were not closely guarded.\n",
      "burnh ----  told them who he was and, as he intended to escape, offered to take back to head-quarters their names or any messages they might wish to send to their people.\n",
      "as twenty yards behind the wagon in which they lay  ----  a mounted guard, the officers told him escape was impossible.\n",
      "he proved otherw ---- e.\n",
      "the trek wagon  ----  drawn by sixteen oxen and driven by a kaffir boy.\n",
      "later in the evening, but while it still  ----  moonlight, the boy descended from his seat and ran forward to belabor the first spans of oxen.\n",
      "this was the opportunity for which burnh ----  had been waiting.\n",
      "slipping quickly over the driver's seat, he dropped between the two \"wheelers\" to the d ---- selboom, or tongue, of the trek wagon.\n",
      "from this he lo ---- d himself and fell between the legs of the oxen on his back in the road.\n",
      "it  ----  four days before he was able to re-enter the british lines, during which time he had been lying in the open veldt, and had subsisted on one biscuit and two handfuls of \"mealies,\" or what we call indian corn.\n",
      "another time when out scouting he and his kaffir boy while on foot  ----  \"jumped\" by a boer commando and forced to hide in two great ant-hills.\n",
      "the boers went into c ---- p on every side of them, and for two days, unknown to themselves, held burnham a prisoner.\n",
      "only at night did he and the cape boy d ----  to crawl out to breathe fresh air and to eat the food tablets they carried in their pockets.\n",
      "on five occasions was burnh ----  sent into the boer lines with dynamite cartridges to blow up the railroad over which the enemy was receiving supplies and ammunition.\n",
      "one of these expeditions nearly ended h ----  life.\n",
      "on june 2, 1901, while trying by night to blow up the line between pretoria and delagoa bay, he  ----  surrounded by a party of boers and could save himself only by instant flight.\n",
      "he threw himself indian fashion along the back of his pony, and had all but got away when a bullet caught the horse and, without even faltering in its stride, it crashed to the ground dead, crushing burnh ----  beneath it and knocking him senseless.\n",
      "he continued unconscious for twenty-four hours, and when he c ---- e to, both friends and foes had departed.\n",
      "bent upon carrying out h ----  orders, although suffering the most acute agony, he crept back to the railroad and destroyed it.\n",
      "knowing the explosion would soon bring the boers, on h ----  hands and knees he crept to an empty kraal, where for two days and nights he lay insensible.\n",
      "at the end of that time he appreciated that he  ----  sinking and that unless he found aid he would die.\n",
      "accordingly, still on h ----  hands and knees, he set forth toward the sound of distant firing.\n",
      "he was indifferent as to whether it c ---- e from the enemy or his own people, but, as it chanced, he was picked up by a patrol of general dickson's brigade, who carried him to pretoria.\n",
      "there the surgeons d ---- covered that in his fall he had torn apart the muscles of the stomach and burst a blood-vessel.\n",
      "that his life  ----  saved, so they informed him, was due only to the fact that for three days he had been without food.\n",
      "his injuries  ----  so serious that he was ordered home.\n",
      "on leaving the army he was given such hearty thanks and generous rewards as no other  ---- erican ever received from the british war office.\n",
      "he  ----  promoted to the rank of major, presented with a large sum of money, and from lord roberts received a personal letter of thanks and appreciation.\n",
      "in part the field-marshal wrote: \"i doubt if any other man in the force could have successfully carried out the thrilling enterpr ---- es in which from time to time you have been engaged, demanding as they did the training of a lifetime, combined with exceptional courage, caution, and powers of endurance.\"\n",
      "on his arrival in england he was commanded to dine with the queen and spend the night at osborne, and a few months later, after her death, king edward created him a member of the distinguished service order, and personally presented him with the south african medal with five bars, and the cross of the d. s. o. while recovering his health burnh ---- , with mrs. burnham, was \"passed on\" by friends he had made in the army from country house to country house; he was made the guest of honor at city banquets, with the duke of rutland rode after the belvoir hounds, and in scotland made mild excursions after grouse.\n",
      "but after six months of convalescence he  ----  off again, this time to the hinterland of ashanti, on the west coast of africa, where he went in the interests of a syndicate to investigate a concession for working gold mines.\n",
      "with his brother-in-law, j. c. blick, he marched and rowed twelve hundred miles, and explored the volta river, at that date so little visited that in one day's journey they counted eleven hippopot ---- uses.\n",
      "in july, 1901, he returned from ashanti, and a few months later an unknown but enthusiastic admirer asked in the house of commons if it were true major burnh ----  had applied for the post of instructor of scouts at aldershot.\n",
      "there is no such post, and burnh ----  had not applied for any other post.\n",
      "the question asked in parli ---- ent was entirely without my knowledge, and i deeply regret that it was asked.\"\n",
      "a few months later, with mrs. burnh ----  and his younger son, bruce, he journeyed to east africa as director of the east african syndicate.\n",
      "during h ----  stay there the _african review_ said of him: \"should east africa ever become a possession for england to be proud of, she will owe much of her prosperity to the brave little band that has faced hardships and dangers in discovering her hidden resources.\n",
      "major burnh ----  has chosen men from england, ireland, the united states, and south africa for sterling qualities, and they have justified his choice.\n",
      "not the least like a hero  ----  the retiring, diffident little major himself, though a finer man for a friend or a better man to serve under would not be found in the five continents.\"\n",
      "burnh ----  explored a tract of land larger than germany, penetrating a thousand miles through a country, never before visited by white men, to the borders of the congo basin.\n",
      "the most interesting result of the expedition was the discovery of a lake forty-nine miles squ ---- , composed almost entirely of pure carbonate of soda, forming a snowlike crust so thick that on it the men could cross the lake.\n",
      "it  ----  the largest, and when the railroad is built--the uganda railroad is now only eighty-eight miles distant--it will be the most valuable deposit of carbonate of soda ever found.\n",
      "a year ago, in the interests of john hays h ---- mond, the distinguished mining engineer of south africa and this country, burnham went to sonora, mexico, to find a buried city and to open up mines of copper and silver.\n",
      "besides seeking for mines, h ---- mond and burnham, with gardner williams, another american who also made his fortune in south africa, are working together on a scheme to import to this country at their own expense many species of south african deer.\n",
      "the south african deer is a hardy animal and can live where the  ---- erican deer cannot, and the idea in importing him is to prevent big game in this country from passing away.\n",

      "has it so absolutely been m ---- led by those who lived and wrote in the days which followed closely on the events that make up this extraordinary narrative?\n",
      "in answering these questions we must consider, in the first place, the scene, and, in the second place, the psychology of the two central characters who for so long a time have  ----  regarded as the very embodiment of unchecked passion.\n",
      "as to the scene, it must be remembered that the egypt of those days  ----  not egyptian as we understand the word, but rather greek.\n",
      "cleopatra herself  ----  of greek descent.\n",
      "the kingdom of egypt had  ----  created by a general of alexander the great after that splendid warrior's death.\n",
      "its capital, the most brilliant city of the greco-roman world, had been founded by alexander himself, who gave to it his n ---- e.\n",
      "with h ----  own hands he traced out the limits of the city and issued the most peremptory orders that it should be made the metropolis of the entire world.\n",
      "the orders of a king cannot give enduring greatness to a city; but alexander's keen eye and marvelous brain saw at once that the site of alexandria  ----  such that a great commercial community planted there would live and flourish throughout out succeeding ages.\n",
      "he was right; for within a century this new capital of egypt leaped to the forefront  ---- ong the exchanges of the world's commerce, while everything that art could do was lavished on its embellishment.\n",
      "to it c ---- e the treasures of the east, brought from afar by caravans--silks from china, spices and pearls from india, and enormous masses of gold and silver from lands scarcely known.\n",
      "in its harbor  ----  the vessels of every country, from asia in the east to spain and gaul and even britain in the west.\n",
      "when cleopatra, a young girl of seventeen, succeeded to the throne of egypt the population of alexandria  ---- ounted to a million souls.\n",
      "the customs duties collected at the port would, in terms of modern money,  ---- ount each year to more than thirty million dollars, even though the imposts were not heavy.\n",
      "the people, who may be described as greek at the top and oriental at the bottom, were boisterous and pleasure-loving, devoted to splendid spectacles, with horse-racing, g ---- bling, and dissipation; yet at the same time they were an artistic people, loving music passionately, and by no means idle, since one part of the city was devoted to large and prosperous manufactories of linen, paper, glass, and muslin.\n",
      "to the outward eye alexandria  ----  extremely beautiful.\n",
      "through its entire length ran two great boulevards, shaded and diversified by mighty trees and parterres of multicolored flowers,  ---- id which fountains plashed and costly marbles gleamed.\n",
      "one-fifth of the whole city  ----  known as the royal residence.\n",
      "in it were the palaces of the reigning f ---- ily, the great museum, and the famous library which the arabs later burned.\n",
      "there  ----  parks and gardens brilliant with tropical foliage and adorned with the masterpieces of grecian sculpture, while sphinxes and obelisks gave a suggestion of oriental strangeness.\n",

      "altogether, alexandria  ----  a city of wealth, of beauty, of stirring life, of excitement, and of pleasure.\n",
      "ferrero has aptly likened it to par ---- --not so much the paris of to-day as the paris of forty years ago, when the second empire flourished in all its splendor as the home of joy and strange delights.\n",

      "he, however, was a mere child of less than twelve, and was under the control of evil counselors, who, in his n ---- e, gained control of the capital and drove cleopatra into exile.\n",
      "until then she had been a mere girl; but now the spirit of a woman who  ----  wronged blazed up in her and called out all her latent powers.\n",
      "but meanwhile julius caesar, the greatest man of ancient times, had arrived at alexandria backed by an army of h ----  veterans.\n",

      "this  ----  a crucial moment in cleopatra's life.\n",
      "she  ----  queen of egypt, and she had redeemed her kingdom and kept it by her sacrifice.\n",
      "in a sense, her act  ----  one of heroism like that of judith in the tent of holofernes.\n",

      "for cleopatra  ----  never beautiful.\n",
      "signor ferrero seems to think this fact to be discovery of his own, but it  ----  set down by plutarch in a very striking passage written less than a century after cleopatra and antony died.\n",
      "we may quote here what the greek historian said of her: her actual beauty was far from being so remarkable that none could be comp ---- d with her, nor was it such that it would strike your fancy when you saw her first.\n",
      "yet the influence of her presence, if you lingered near her,  ----  irresistible.\n",
      "her attractive personality, joined with the charm of her conversation, and the individual touch that she gave to everything she said or did,  ----  utterly bewitching.\n",
      "it  ----  delightful merely to hear the music of her voice, with which, like an instrument of many strings, she could pass from one language to another.\n",
      "for six years she reigned with great intelligence, keeping order in her dominions, and patronizing with d ---- crimination both arts and letters.\n",
      "caesar had  ----  assassinated, and there ensued a period of civil war.\n",
      "out of it emerged two striking figures which  ----  absolutely contrasted in their character.\n",
      "one  ----  octavian, the adopted son of caesar, a man who, though still quite young and possessed of great ability, was cunning, cold-blooded, and deceitful.\n",
      "the other  ----  antony, a soldier by training, and with all a soldier's bluntness, courage, and lawlessness.\n",
      "the roman world  ----  divided for the time between these two men, antony receiving the government of the east, octavian that of the west.\n",
      "in the year which had preceded th ----  division cleopatra had wavered between the two opposite factions at rome.\n",
      "he was essentially a soldier, of excellent f ---- ily, being related to caesar himself.\n",
      "as a very young man he  ----  exceedingly handsome, and bad companions led him into the pursuit of vicious pleasure.\n",
      "but he  ----  much more than a mere man of pleasure, given over to drinking and to dissipation.\n",
      "men might tell of h ----  escapades, as when he drove about the streets of rome in a common cab, dangling his legs out of the window while he shouted forth drunken songs of revelry.\n",
      "this  ----  not the whole of antony.\n",
      "joining the roman army in syria, he showed himself to be a soldier of great personal bravery, a clever strateg ---- t, and also humane and merciful in the hour of victory.\n",
      "unlike most romans, antony wore a full  ---- ard.\n",
      "his forehead  ----  large, and his nose was of the distinctive roman type.\n",
      "his look  ----  so bold and masculine that people likened him to hercules.\n",
      "his democratic manners ende ---- d him to the army.\n",
      "he wore a plain tunic covered with a large, coarse mantle, and carried a huge sword at h ----  side, despising ostentation.\n",
      "even h ----  faults and follies added to his popularity.\n",
      "he spent money like water, quickly recognizing any daring deed which h ----  legionaries performed.\n",
      "in this respect he  ----  like napoleon; and, like napoleon, he had a vein of florid eloquence which was criticized by literary men, but which went straight to the heart of the private soldier.\n",
      "in a word, he was a powerful, virile, passionate, able man, rough, as  ----  nearly all his countrymen, but strong and true.\n",

      "pierre abelard--or, more fully, pierre abelard de palais--was a native of brittany, born in the year 1079. his father was a knight, the lord of the manor; but abelard c ---- d little for the life of a petty noble; and so he gave up his seigniorial rights to his brothers and went forth to become, first of all a student, and then a public lecturer and teacher.\n",
      "his student days ended abruptly in paris, where he had enrolled himself as the pupil of a distinguished philosopher, guillaume de ch ---- peaux; but one day abelard engaged in a disputation with his master.\n",

      "he was the first of many enemies that abelard was destined to make in his long and stormy c ---- er.\n",
      "from that moment the young breton himself set up as a teacher of philosophy, and the brilliancy of h ----  discourses soon drew to him throngs of students from all over europe.\n",

      "the leaven of a true christianity  ----  working in the half-pagan populations.\n",
      "it had not yet completely reached the nobles and the knights, or even all the ecclesiastics who served it and who  ----  consecrated to its mission.\n",

      "the jealousy of ch ---- peaux drove abelard for a time from paris.\n",
      "he taught and lectured at several other centers of learning, always admired, and yet at the s ---- e time denounced by many for his advocacy of reason as against blind faith.\n",
      "during the years of his wandering he c ---- e to have a wide knowledge of the world and of human nature.\n",
      "if we try to imagine him as he  ----  in his thirty-fifth year we shall find in him a remarkable combination of attractive qualities.\n",
      "it must be remembered that though, in a sense, he  ----  an ecclesiastic, he had not yet been ordained to the priesthood, but was rather a canon--a person who did not belong to any religious order, though he was supposed to live according to a definite set of religious rules and as a member of a religious community.\n",
      "abelard, however, made rather light of h ----  churchly associations.\n",
      "he  ----  at once an accomplished man of the world and a profound scholar.\n",
      "there  ----  nothing of the recluse about him.\n",
      "he mingled with h ----  fellow men, whom he dominated by the charm of his personality.\n",
      "he  ----  eloquent, ardent, and persuasive.\n",
      "he could turn a delicate compliment as skilfully as he could elaborate a syllog ---- m.\n",
      "his rich voice had in it a seductive quality which  ----  never without its effect.\n",
      "nor  ----  his accomplishments entirely those of the scholar.\n",
      "he wrote dainty verses, which he also set to music, and which he sang himself with a r ----  skill.\n",
      "some have called him \"the first of the troubadours,\" and many who c ---- d nothing for his skill in logic admired him for his gifts as a musician and a poet.\n",
      "altogether, he  ----  one to attract attention wherever he went, for none could fail to recognize his power.\n",
      "it  ----  soon after his thirty-fifth year that he returned to paris, where he was welcomed by thousands.\n",
      "with much tact he reconciled himself to h ----  enemies, so that his life now seemed to be full of promise and of sunshine.\n",
      "it was at this time that he bec ---- e acquainted with a very beautiful young girl named heloise.\n",
      "she was only eighteen years of age, yet already she possessed not only beauty, but many accomplishments which were then quite r ----  in women, since she both wrote and spoke a number of languages, and, like abelard, was a lover of music and poetry.\n",
      "heloise was the illegitimate daughter of a canon of patrician blood; so that she is said to have been a worthy representative of the noble house of the montmorencys--f ---- ous throughout french history for chivalry and charm.\n",
      "up to th ----  time we do not know precisely what sort of life abelard had lived in private.\n",
      "his enemies decl ---- d that he had squandered his substance in vicious ways.\n",
      "h ----  friends denied this, and represented him as strict and chaste.\n",
      "the truth probably lies  ---- tween these two assertions.\n",
      "he  ----  naturally a pleasure-loving man of the world, who may very possibly have relieved his severer studies by occasional revelry and light love.\n",
      "it is not at all likely that he  ----  addicted to gross passions and low practices.\n",
      "but such as he  ---- , when he first saw heloise he conceived for her a violent attachment.\n",
      "carefully guarded in the house of her uncle, fulbert, it was difficult at first for abelard to meet her save in the most casual way; yet every time that he heard her exquisite voice and watched her graceful manners he bec ---- e more and more infatuated.\n",
      "his studies suddenly seemed t ---- e and colorless beside the fierce scarlet flame which blazed up in his heart.\n",
      "nevertheless, it  ----  because of these studies and of his great reputation as a scholar that he managed to obtain access to heloise.\n",
      "he flattered her uncle and made a chance proposal that he should himself become an inmate of fulbert's household in order that he might teach th ----  girl of so much promise.\n",
      "such an offer coming from so brilliant a man  ----  joyfully accepted.\n",
      "from that time abelard could v ---- it heloise without restraint.\n",
      "he  ----  her teacher, and the two spent hours together, nominally in the study of greek and hebrew; but doubtless very little was said between them upon such unattractive subjects.\n",
      "on the contrary, with all h ----  wide experience of life, his eloquence, his perfect manners, and his fascination, abelard put forth his power to captivate the senses of a girl still in her teens and quite ignorant of the world.\n",
      "it was then that the pleasures of knowledge, the joys of thought, the emotions of eloquence,  ----  all called into play to charm and move and plunge into a profound and strange intoxication this noble and tender heart which had never known either love or sorrow.\n",
      "their studies gave them opportunities to see each other freely, and also permitted them to  ----  alone together.\n",
      "then their books lay open  ---- tween them; but either long periods of silence stilled their reading, or else words of deepening intimacy made them forget their studies altogether.\n",
      "the eyes of the two lovers turned from the book to mingle their glances, and then to turn away in a confusion that  ----  conscious.\n",
      "hand would touch hand, app ---- ntly by accident; and when conversation ceased, abelard would often hear the long, quivering sigh which showed the strange, half-frightened, and yet exquisite joy which heloise experienced.\n",
      "it  ----  not long before the girl's heart had been wholly won.\n",
      "transported by her emotion, she met the c ---- sses of her lover with those as unrestrained as his.\n",
      "all was given freely, and even wildly, by heloise; and all was taken by abelard, who afterward himself decl ---- d: \"the pleasure of teaching her to love surpassed the delightful fragrance of all the perfumes in the world.\"\n",
      "yet these two could not always live in a paradise which  ----  entirely their own.\n",
      "the world of par ----  took notice of their close association.\n",
      "some poems written to heloise by abelard, as if in letters of fire,  ----  found and shown to fulbert, who, until this time, had suspected nothing.\n",
      "angrily he ordered abelard to leave h ----  house.\n",
      "he forbade h ----  niece to see her lover any more.\n",
      "but the two could not be separated; and, indeed, there  ----  good reason why they should still cling together.\n",
      "secretly heloise left her uncle's house and fled through the narrow lanes of paris to the dwelling of abelard's sister, denyse, where abelard himself  ----  living.\n",
      "there, presently, the young girl gave birth to a son, who was n ---- ed astrolabe, after an instrument used by astronomers, since both the father and the mother felt that the offspring of so great a love should have no ordinary name.\n",
      "fulbert  ----  furious, and rightly so.\n",
      "h ----  hospitality had been outraged and his niece dishonored.\n",
      "he ins ---- ted that the pair should at once be married.\n",
      "here  ----  revealed a certain weakness in the character of abelard.\n",
      "he consented to the marriage, but ins ---- ted that it should be kept an utter secret.\n",
      "oddly enough, it  ----  heloise herself who objected to becoming the wife of the man she loved.\n",
      "unself ---- hness could go no farther.\n",
      "she saw that,  ----  he to marry her, his advancement in the church would be almost impossible; for, while the very minor clergy sometimes married in spite of the papal bulls, matrimony was becoming a fatal bar to ecclesiastical promotion.\n",
      "and so helo ---- e pleaded pitifully, both with her uncle and with abelard, that there should be no marriage.\n",
      "she would rather bear all manner of d ---- grace than stand in the way of abelard's advancement.\n",
      "how outrageous would it be that you, whom nature created for the universal good, should be devoted to one woman and plunged into such d ---- grace?\n",
      "indeed, every possible effort which another woman in her place would employ to make him marry her she used in order to d ---- suade him.\n",
      "finally, her sweet face stre ---- ing with tears, she uttered that tremendous sentence which makes one really think that she loved him as no other woman ever loved a man.\n",
      "she cried out, in an agony of self-sacrifice: \"i would rather be your m ---- tress than the wife even of an emperor!\"\n",
      "nevertheless, the two  ----  married, and abelard returned to his lecture-room and to his studies.\n",
      "meanwhile, however, the taunts and innuendos directed against heloise so irritated fulbert that he broke his promise of secrecy, and told his friends that abelard and heloise  ----  man and wife.\n",
      "they went to helo ---- e for confirmation.\n",
      "\"i  ----  no wife,\" she said.\n",
      "\"it  ----  not true that abelard has married me.\n",
      "my uncle merely tells you th ----  to save my reputation.\"\n",
      "they asked her whether she would swear to th ---- ; and, without a moment's hesitation, this pure and noble woman took an oath upon the scriptures that there had been no marriage.\n",
      "fulbert  ----  enraged by this.\n",
      "he ill-treated helo ---- e, and, furthermore, he forbade abelard to visit her.\n",
      "the girl, therefore, again left her uncle's house and betook herself to a convent just outside of par ---- , where she assumed the habit of a nun as a disguise.\n",
      "there a ---- lard continued from time to time to meet her.\n",
      "when fulbert heard of th ----  he put his own interpretation on it.\n",
      "he  ---- lieved that abelard intended to ignore the marriage altogether, and that possibly he might even marry some other woman.\n",
      "in any case, he now hated abelard with all his heart; and he resolved to take a fearful and unnatural vengeance which would at once prevent his enemy from making any other marriage, while at the s ---- e time it would debar him from ecclesiastical preferment.\n",
      "to carry out his plot fulbert first bribed a man who  ----  the body-servant of abelard, watching at the door of his room each night.\n",

      "early the next morning the news flew rapidly through par ---- .\n",
      "the city hummed like a  ---- e-hive.\n",
      "citizens and students and ecclesiastics poured into the street and surrounded the house of a ---- lard.\n",

      "fulbert himself was accused before one of the church courts, which alone had power to punish an ecclesiastic, and all his goods  ----  confiscated.\n",
      "but, meantime, how did it f ----  with heloise?\n",
      "her grief was greater than his own, while her love and her devotion  ----  absolutely undiminished.\n",
      "but abelard now showed a self ---- hness--and indeed, a meanness--far beyond any that he had before exhibited.\n",
      "helo ---- e could no more be his wife.\n",
      "he  ----  unwilling that she should live in the world while he could not; and so he told her sternly that she must take the veil and bury herself for ever in a nunnery.\n",
      "the pain and sh ---- e which she experienced at this came wholly from the fact that evidently abelard did not trust her.\n",
      "it  ----  his distrust that cut her to the heart.\n",
      "still, her love for him  ----  so intense that she obeyed his order.\n",
      "soon after she took the vows; and in the convent chapel, shaken with sobs, she knelt before the altar and assumed the veil of a clo ---- tered nun.\n",
      "abelard himself put on the black tunic of a benedictine monk and entered the abbey of st. den ---- .\n",
      "it  ----  unnecessary here to follow out all the details of the lives of abelard and heloise after this heart-rendering scene.\n",
      "abelard passed through many years of strife and disappointment, and even of humiliation; for on one occasion, just as he had silenced guillaume de ch ---- peaux, so he himself was silenced and put to rout by bernard of clairvaux--\"a frail, tense, absorbed, dominant little man, whose face was white and worn with suffering,\" but in whose eyes there was a light of supreme strength.\n",
      " ---- rnard represented pure faith, as abelard represented pure reason; and the two men met before a great council to match their respective powers.\n",
      "bernard, with fiery eloquence, brought a charge of heresy against abelard in an oration which  ----  like a charge of cavalry.\n",
      "when he had concluded abelard rose with an ashen face, st ---- mered out a few words, and sat down.\n",
      "he was condemned by the council, and his works  ----  ordered to be burned.\n",
      "all his later life  ----  one of misfortune, of humiliation, and even of personal danger.\n",
      "his life  ----  threatened.\n",
      "he betook himself to a desolate and lonely place, where he built for himself a hut of reeds and rushes, hoping to spend h ----  final years in meditation.\n",
      "but there  ----  many who had not forgotten his ability as a teacher.\n",
      "his hut  ----  surrounded by tents and rude hovels, built by his scholars for their shelter.\n",
      "thus abelard resumed his teaching, though in a very different fr ---- e of mind.\n",
      "in time he built a structure of wood and stone, which he called the paraclete, some remains of which can still  ----  seen.\n",
      "all th ----  time no word had passed between him and heloise.\n",
      "but presently abelard wrote and gave to the world a curious and exceedingly frank book, which he called the story of my m ---- fortunes.\n",
      "a copy of it reached the hands of helo ---- e, and she at once sent to abelard the first of a series of letters which have remained unique in the literature of love.\n",
      "ten years had passed, and yet the woman's heart  ----  as faithful and as full of yearning as on the day when the two had parted.\n",
      "it has been said that the letters  ----  not genuine, and they must be read with this assertion in mind; yet it is difficult to believe that any one save heloise herself could have flung a human soul into such frankly passionate utterances, or that any imitator could have done the work.\n",
      "in her first letter, which  ----  sent to abelard written upon parchment, she said: at thy command i would change, not merely my costume, but my very soul, so entirely art thou the sole possessor of my body and my spirit.\n",
      "never, god  ----  my witness, never have i sought anything in thee but thyself; i have sought thee, and not thy gifts.\n",
      "she  ---- gged him to write to her, and to lead her to god, as once he had led her into the mysteries of pleasure.\n",
      "abelard ans ---- d in a letter, friendly to be sure, but formal--the letter of a priest to a cloistered nun.\n",
      "the opening words of it  ----  characteristic of the whole: to heloise, his sister in christ, from abelard, her brother in him.\n",
      "the letter  ----  a long one, but throughout the whole of it the writer's tone was cold and prudent.\n",
      "her second letter bursts forth in a sort of anguish: how hast thou been able to fr ---- e such thoughts, dearest?\n",
      "oh, if i d ---- d but call god cruel to me!\n",
      "oh, most wretched of all creatures that i  ---- !\n",
      "so sweet did i find the pleasures of our loving days that i cannot bring myself to reject them or to ban ---- h them from my memory.\n",
      "wheresoever i go, they thrust themselves upon my v ---- ion, and rekindle the old desire.\n",
      "but abelard knew only too well that not in th ----  life could there be anything save spiritual love between himself and heloise.\n",
      "he wrote to her again and again, always in the s ---- e remote and unimpassioned way.\n",
      "he tells her about the history of monasticism, and discusses with her matters of theology and ethics; but he never writes one word to feed the fl ---- e that is consuming her.\n",
      "the woman understood at last; and by degrees her letters bec ---- e as calm as his--suffused, however, with a tenderness and feeling which showed that in her heart of hearts she was still entirely given to him.\n",
      "after some years abelard left his dwelling at the paraclete, and there was founded there a religious house of which heloise bec ---- e the abbess.\n",
      "all the world respected her for her sweetness, her w ---- dom, and the purity of her character.\n",
      "she made friends as easily as a ---- lard made enemies.\n",
      "even bernard, who had overthrown her husband, sought out helo ---- e to ask for her advice and counsel.\n",
      "abelard died while on his way to rome, whither he  ----  journeying in order to undergo a penalty; and his body was brought back to the paraclete, where it was entombed.\n",
      "over it for twenty-two years heloise watched with tender c ---- ; and when she died, her body was laid beside that of her lover.\n",
      "to-day their bones  ----  mingled as she would have desired them to be mingled.\n",
      "the stones of their tomb in the great cemetery of pere lachaise were brought from the ruins of the paraclete, and above the sarcophagus  ----  two recumbent figures, the whole being the work of the artist alexandra lenoir, who died in 1836. the figure representing heloise is not, however, an authentic likeness.\n",
      "the model for it was a lady belonging to a noble f ---- ily of france, and the figure itself was brought to pere lachaise from the ancient college de beauvais.\n",
      "the letters of helo ---- e have been read and imitated throughout the whole of the last nine centuries.\n",
      "some have found in them the utterances of a woman whose love of love  ----  greater than her love of god and whose intensity of passion nothing could subdue; and so these have condemned her.\n",
      "but others, like chateaubriand, have more truly seen in them a pure and noble spirit to whom fate had been very cruel; and who  ---- , after all, writing to the man who had been her lawful husband.\n",
      "some of the most f ---- ous imitations of her letters are those in the ancient poem entitled, \"the romance of the rose,\" written by jean de meung, in the thirteenth century; and in modern times her first letter was paraphrased by alexander pope, and in french by colardeau.\n",
      "there ex ---- t in english half a dozen translations of them, with abelard's replies.\n",
      "it  ----  interesting to remember that practically all the other writings of abelard remained unpublished and unedited until a very recent period.\n",
      "he was a remarkable figure as a philosopher and scholar; but the world c ---- s for him only because he was loved by heloise.\n",
      "queen elizabeth and the earl of leicester h ---- tory has many romantic stories to tell of the part which women have played in determining the destinies of nations.\n",
      "sometimes it  ----  a woman's beauty that causes the shifting of a province.\n",
      "again it  ----  another woman's rich possessions that incite invasion and lead to bloody wars.\n",
      "marriages or dowries, or the refusal of marriages and the lack of dowries, inheritance through an heiress, the failure of a male succession--in these and in many other ways women have set their mark indelibly upon the trend of h ---- tory.\n",
      "however, if we look over these different events we shall find that it  ----  not so much the mere longing for a woman--the desire to have her as a queen--that has seriously affected the annals of any nation.\n",
      "most royal marriages  ----  made either to secure the succession to a throne by a legitimate line of heirs or else to unite adjoining states and make a powerful kingdom out of two that are less powerful.\n",
      "but, as a rule, kings have found greater delight in some sheltered bower remote from courts than in the castled halls and well-c ---- d-for nooks where their own wives and children have been reared with all the appurtenances of legitimacy.\n",
      "there  ----  not many stories that hang persistently about the love-making of a single woman.\n",
      "in the case of one or another we may find an ep ---- ode or two--something dashing, something spirited or striking, something brilliant and exhilarating, or something sad.\n",
      "but for a woman's whole life to be spent in courtship that meant nothing and that  ----  only a clever aid to diplomacy--this is surely an unusual and really wonderful thing.\n",
      "it is the more unusual because the woman herself  ----  not intended by nature to be wasted upon the cold and cheerless sport of chancellors and counselors and men who had no thought of her except to use her as a pawn.\n",
      "she  ----  hot-blooded, descended from a fiery race, and one whose temper was quick to leap into the passion of a man.\n",
      "in studying th ----  phase of the long and interesting life of elizabeth of england we must notice several important facts.\n",
      "in the first place, she gave herself, above all else, to the maintenance of england--not an england that would be half spanish or half french, or even partly dutch and flemish, but the merry england of tradition--the england that was one and undivided, with its growing freedom of thought, its bows and bills, its nut-brown ale, its sturdy yeomen, and its loyalty to crown and parli ---- ent.\n",
      "and one may really hold that this  ----  true.\n",
      "for england she left herself on record as an arrant liar, false, perjured, yet successful; and because of her success for england's sake her countrymen will hold her in high remembrance, since her scheming and her falsehood  ----  the offenses that one pardons most readily in a woman.\n",
      "in the second place, it must be remembered that elizabeth's courtships and pretended love-makings  ----  almost always a part of her diplomacy.\n",
      "when not a part of her diplomacy they  ----  a mere appendage to her vanity.\n",
      "to seem to be the flower of the english people, and to be surrounded by the noblest, the bravest, and the most handsome cavaliers, not only of her own kingdom, but of others--this  ---- , indeed, a choice morsel of which she was fond of tasting, even though it meant nothing beyond the moment.\n",
      "finally, though at times she could be very cold, and though she made herself still colder in order that she might play fast and loose with foreign suitors who played fast and loose with her--the king of spain, the duc d'alencon, brother of the french king, with an austrian archduke, with a magnificent barbarian prince of muscovy, with eric of sweden, or any other scandinavian suitor--she felt a woman's need for some ne ---- r and more tender association to which she might give freer play and in which she might feel those deeper emotions without the danger that arises when love is mingled with diplomacy.\n",
      "let us first consider a picture of the woman as she really  ----  in order that we may understand her triple nature--consummate mistress of every art that statesmen know, and using at every moment her person as a lure; a vain-glorious queen who seemed to be the prey of boundless vanity; and, lastly, a woman who had all a woman's passion, and who could cast suddenly aside the check and balance which restrained her before the public gaze and could allow herself to give full play to the emotion that she inherited from the king, her father, who was himself a marvel of fire and impetuosity.\n",
      "and anne boleyn should  ----  a gentle, timid maiden would be to make heredity a farce.\n",
      "elizabeth  ----  about twenty-five years of age when she ascended the throne of england.\n",
      "it  ----  odd that the date of her birth cannot be given with precision.\n",
      "the intrigues and disturbances of the english court, and the fact that she  ----  a princess, made her birth a matter of less account than if there had been no male heir to the throne.\n",
      "at any rate, when she ascended it, after the deaths of her brother, king edward vi., and her sister, queen mary, she  ----  a woman well trained both in intellect and in physical development.\n",
      "mr. martin hume, who loves to dwell upon the later years of queen eliza ---- th, speaks rather bitterly of her as a \"painted old harridan\"; and such she may well have seemed when, at nearly seventy years of age, she leered and grinned a sort of skeleton smile at the handsome young courtiers who pretended to see in her the queen of beauty and to be dying for love of her.\n",
      "yet, in her earlier years, when she  ----  young and strong and impetuous, she deserved far different words than these.\n",
      "the portrait of her by zucchero, which now hangs in h ---- pton court, depicts her when she must have been of more than middle age; and still the face is one of beauty, though it be a strange and almost artificial beauty--one that draws, attracts, and, perhaps, lures you on against your will.\n",
      "it is interesting to comp ----  this painting with the frank word-picture of a certain german agent who was sent to england by his emperor, and who seems to have been greatly fascinated by queen elizabeth.\n",
      "she  ----  at that time in the prime of her beauty and her power.\n",
      "her complexion was of that peculiar transp ---- ncy which is seen only in the face of golden blondes.\n",
      "her figure  ----  fine and graceful, and her wit an accomplishment that would have made a woman of any rank or time remarkable.\n",
      "the german envoy says: she lives a life of such magnificence and feasting as can hardly be imagined, and occupies a great portion of her time with balls, banquets, hunting, and similar  ---- usements, with the utmost possible display, but nevertheless she insists upon far greater respect being shown her than was exacted by queen mary.\n",
      "she summons parli ---- ent, but lets them know that her orders must be obeyed in any case.\n",
      "if any one will look at the painting by zucchero he will see how much is made of elizabeth's hands--a distinctive feature quite as noble with the tudors as is the \"hapsburg lip\"  ---- ong the descendants of the house of austria.\n",
      "these  ----  ungloved, and were very long and white, and she looked at them and played with them a great deal; and, indeed, they justified the admiration with which they were regarded by her flatterers.\n",
      "such  ----  the personal appearance of elizabeth.\n",
      "when a young girl, we have still more favorable opinions of her that  ----  written by those who had occasion to be near her.\n",
      "not only do they record swift glimpses of her person, but sometimes in a word or two they give an insight into certain traits of mind which c ---- e out prominently in her later years.\n",
      "it may, perhaps,  ----  well to view her as a woman before we regard her more fully as a queen.\n",
      "it has been said that elizabeth inherited many of the traits of her father--the boldness of spirit, the rapidity of decision, and, at the s ---- e time, the fox-like craft which often showed itself when it was least expected.\n",
      "henry had also, as  ----  well known, a love of the other sex, which has made his reign memorable.\n",
      "and yet it must be noted that while he loved much, it  ----  not loose love.\n",
      "where henry loved, he married; and it  ----  the unfortunate result of these royal marriages that has made him seem unduly fond of women.\n",
      "if, however, we ex ---- ine each one of the separate espousals we shall find that he did not enter into it lightly, and that he broke it off unwillingly.\n",
      "his ardent temper ---- ent, therefore, was checked by a certain rational or conventional propriety, so that he was by no means a loose liver, as many would make him out to be.\n",
      "we must remember this when we recall the charges that have been made against elizabeth, and the strange stories that  ----  told of her tricks--by no means seemly tricks--which she used to play with her guardian, lord thomas seymour.\n",
      "the antics she performed with him in her dressing-room were made the subject of an official inquiry; yet it c ---- e out that while elizabeth was less than sixteen, and lord thomas was very much her senior, his wife was with him on his visits to the chamber of the princess.\n",
      "sir robert tyrwhitt and his wife were also sent to question her, tyrwhitt had a keen mind and one well trained to cope with any other's wit in this sort of cross-ex ---- ination.\n",
      "elizabeth  ----  only a girl of fifteen, yet she was a match for the accomplished courtier in diplomacy and quick retort.\n",
      "he  ----  sent down to worm out of her everything that she knew.\n",
      "threats and flattery and forged letters and false confessions  ----  tried on her; but they were tried in vain.\n",
      "not a comprom ---- ing word could they wring out of her.\n",
      "she bitterly complained of the impr ---- onment of her governess, mrs. ashley, and cried out: \"i have not so behaved that you need put more mistresses upon me!\"\n",
      "altogether, she  ----  too much for sir robert, and he was wise enough to recognize her cleverness.\n",
      "\"she hath a very good wit,\" said he, shrewdly; \"and nothing  ----  to be gotten of her except by great policy.\"\n",
      "mr. hume notes the fact that after the two servants of the princess had been ex ---- ined and had told nothing very serious they found that they had been wise in remaining friends of the royal girl.\n",
      "no sooner had elizabeth become queen than she knighted the man parry and made him treasurer of the household, while mrs. ashley, the governess,  ----  treated with great consideration.\n",
      "even tyrwhitt believed that there  ----  a secret compact between them, for he said, quaintly: \"they all sing one song, and she hath set the note for them.\"\n",
      "soon after th ----  her brother edward's death brought to the throne her elder sister, mary, who has harshly become known as bloody mary.\n",
      "during this time elizabeth put aside her boldness, and bec ---- e apparently a shy and simple-minded virgin.\n",
      "surrounded on every side by those who sought to trap her, there  ----  nothing in her bearing to make her seem the head of a party or the young chief of a faction.\n",
      "she spoke of her s ---- ter in the humblest terms.\n",
      "she exhibited no signs of the tudor animation that  ----  in reality so strong a part of her character.\n",
      "they thought much better of her than they had of her saturnine s ---- ter, the first queen mary.\n",
      "the life of elizabeth has been very oddly m ---- understood, not so much for the facts in it as for the manner in which these have been arranged and the relation which they have to one another.\n",
      "we ought to recollect that this woman did not live in a restricted sphere, that her life  ----  not a short one, and that it was crowded with incidents and full of vivid color.\n",
      "some think of her as living for a short period of time and speak of the great h ---- torical characters who surrounded her as belonging to a single epoch.\n",
      "to them she has one set of suitors all the time--the duc d'alencon, the king of denmark's brother, the prince of sweden, the russian potentate, the archduke sending her sweet messages from austria, the melancholy king of spain, together with a number of her own brilliant englishmen--sir willi ----  pickering, sir robert dudley, lord darnley, the earl of essex, sir philip sidney, and sir walter raleigh.\n",
      "of course, as a matter of fact, elizabeth lived for nearly seventy years--almost three-quarters of a century--and in that long time there c ---- e and went both men and women, those whom she had used and cast aside, with others whom she had also treated with gratitude, and who had died gladly serving her.\n",
      "but through it all there  ----  a continual change in her environment, though not in her.\n",
      "the young soldier went to the battle-field and died; the wise counselor gave her his advice, and she either took it or c ---- d nothing for it.\n"

      "mary stuart's love life makes a piteous story, for it is the life of one who was ever seeking--seeking for the man to whom she could look up, who could be strong and brave and ardent like herself, and at the s ---- e time be more powerful and more steadfast even than she herself in mind and thought.\n",

      "h ----  high color, while it betokened high feeding, got him the credit of good health.\n",
      "his little eyes twinkled so merrily that you did not see they  ----  like a pig's, sly and greedy at once, and bloodshot.\n",
      "h ----  tawny beard concealed a jaw underhung, a chin jutting and dangerous.\n",
      "h ----  mouth had a cruel twist; but his laughing hid that too.\n",

      "she grew to look eagerly for the frank mockery \"in those twinkling eyes, in that quick mouth\"; and to wonder whether it  ----  with him always--asleep, at prayers, fighting, furious, or in love.\n",
      "something more, however, must  ----  said of bothwell.\n",
      "he  ----  undoubtedly a roisterer, but he was very much a man.\n",
      "h ----  sword leaped quickly from its sheath.\n",

      "chr ---- tina consented to be crowned, but she absolutely refused all thought of marriage.\n",
      "she had more suitors from all parts of europe than even eliza ---- th of england; but, unlike elizabeth, she did not dally with them, give them false hopes, or use them for the political advantage of her kingdom.\n",
      "at that time sweden  ----  stronger than england, and was so situated as to be independent of alliances.\n",
      "so chr ---- tina said, in her harsh, peremptory voice: \"i shall never marry; and why should you speak of my having children!\n",
      "i  ----  just as likely to give birth to a nero as to an augustus.\"\n",
      "having assumed the throne, she ruled with a strictness of government such as sweden had not known  ---- fore.\n",
      "she took the reins of state into her own hands and carried out a foreign policy of her own, over the heads of her min ---- ters, and even against the wishes of her people.\n",
      "for this reason the war  ----  popular, and every one wished it to go on; but christina, of her own will, decided that it must stop, that mere glory was not to be considered against material advantages.\n",
      "therefore, in 1648, against oxenstierna, against her generals, and against her people, she exerc ---- ed her royal power and brought the thirty years' war to an end by the so-called peace of westphalia.\n",
      "at this time she  ----  twenty-two, and by her personal influence she had ended one of the greatest struggles of history.\n",

      "this girl queen, without intrigue, without descending from her native nobility to peep and whisper with shady diplomats, showed herself in reality a great monarch, a true semir ---- is of the north, more worthy of respect and reverence than elizabeth of england.\n",
      "she  ----  highly trained in many arts.\n",
      "she  ----  fond of study, spoke latin fluently, and could argue with salmasius, descartes, and other accomplished scholars without showing any inferiority to them.\n",
      "she gathered at her court d ---- tinguished persons from all countries.\n",
      "she repelled those who sought her hand, and she  ----  pure and truthful and worthy of all men's admiration.\n",
      "had she died at th ----  time history would rank her with the greatest of women sovereigns.\n",
      "naude, the librarian of cardinal mazarin, wrote of her to the scientist gassendi in these words: to say truth, i  ----  sometimes afraid lest the common saying should be verified in her, that short is the life and rare the old age of those who surpass the common limits.\n",
      "do not imagine that she  ----  learned only in books, for she is equally so in painting, architecture, sculpture, medals, antiquities, and all curiosities.\n",
      "there  ----  not a cunning workman in these arts but she has him fetched.\n",
      "there are as good workers in wax and in en ---- el, engravers, singers, players, dancers here as will be found anywhere.\n",
      "she has a gallery of statues, bronze and marble, medals of gold, silver, and bronze, pieces of ivory,  ---- ber, coral, worked crystal, steel mirrors, clocks and tables, bas-reliefs and other things of the kind; richer i have never seen even in italy; finally, a great quantity of pictures.\n",
      "in short, her mind  ----  open to all impressions.\n",
      "but after she began to make her court a sort of home for art and letters it ceased to be the sort of court that sweden was prep ---- d for.\n",
      "christina's subjects  ----  still rude and lacking in accomplishments; therefore she had to summon men of genius from other countries, especially from france and italy.\n",
      "many of these were illustrious artists or scholars, but  ---- ong them were also some who used their mental gifts for harm.\n",
      " ---- ong these latter was a french physician named bourdelot--a man of keen intellect, of winning manners, and of a profound cynicism, which was not apparent on the surface, but the effect of which last lasting.\n",
      "to bourdelot we must chiefly ascribe the mysterious change which gradually c ---- e over queen christina.\n",
      "with h ----  associates he taught her a distaste for the simple and healthy life that she had been accustomed to lead.\n",
      "she ceased to think of the welf ----  of the state and began to look down with scorn upon her unsophisticated swedes.\n",
      "foreign luxury d ---- played itself at stockholm, and her palaces overflowed with beautiful things.\n",
      "having been a stoic, she now bec ---- e an epicurean.\n",
      "she  ----  by nature devoid of sentiment.\n",
      "she would not spend her time in the niceties of love-making, as did elizabeth; but beneath the surface she had a sort of tiger ---- h, passionate nature, which would break forth at intervals, and which demanded satisfaction from a series of favorites.\n",
      "it is probable that bourdelot was her first lover, but there were many others whose n ---- es are recorded in the annals of the time.\n",
      "when she threw aside her virtue christina ceased to c ----  about appearances.\n",
      "what she retained of her former self was a c ---- lessness that braved the opinion of her subjects.\n",
      "she dressed almost without thought, and it  ----  said that she combed her hair not more than twice a month.\n",
      "she caroused with male companions to the scandal of her people, and she swore like a trooper when d ---- pleased.\n",
      "chr ---- tina's philosophy of life appears to have been compounded of an almost brutal licentiousness, a strong love of power, and a strange, freakish longing for something new.\n",
      "her political  ---- bitions were checked by the rising discontent of her people, who began to look down upon her and to feel ashamed of her shame.\n",
      "knowing herself as she did, she did not c ----  to marry.\n",
      "therefore she chose out her cousin charles, decl ---- d that he was to be her successor, and finally caused him to be proclaimed as such before the assembled estates of the realm.\n",
      "she even had him crowned; and finally, in her twenty-eighth year, she abdicated altogether and prep ---- d to leave sweden.\n",
      "they  ----  to be her subjects until the end.\n",
      "the swedes remembered that christina  ----  the daughter of their greatest king, and that, apart from personal scandals, she had ruled them well; and so they let her go regretfully and accepted her cousin as their king.\n",
      "chr ---- tina, on her side, went joyfully and in the spirit of a grand adventuress.\n",
      "with a numerous suite she entered germany, and then stayed for a year at brussels, where she renounced lutheran ---- m.\n",
      "after this she traveled slowly into italy, where she entered borne on horseback, and was received by the pope, alexander vii., who lodged her in a magnificent palace, accepted her conversion, and baptized her, giving her a new n ---- e, alexandra.\n",
      "in rome she was a brilliant but erratic personage, living sumptuously, even though her revenues from sweden c ---- e in slowly, partly because the swedes disliked her change of religion.\n",
      "she was surrounded by men of letters, with whom she  ---- used herself, and she took to herself a lover, the marquis monaldeschi.\n",
      "she thought that at last she had really found her true affinity, while monaldeschi  ---- lieved that he could count on the queen's fidelity.\n",
      "he was in attendance upon her daily, and they  ----  almost inseparable.\n",
      "for a time he  ----  the master of those intense emotions which, in her, alternated with moods of coldness and even cruelty.\n",
      "monaldeschi  ----  a handsome italian, who bore himself with a fine air of breeding.\n",
      "he understood the art of charming, but he did not know that beyond a certain time no one could hold the affections of chr ---- tina.\n",
      "however, after she had quarreled with various cardinals and decided to leave rome for a while, monaldeschi accompanied her to france, where she had an immense vogue at the court of lou ----  xiv.\n",
      "she attracted wide attention  ---- cause of her eccentricity and utter lack of manners.\n",
      "they, in return, would speak of christina's deformed shoulder and skinny fr ---- e; but the king was very gracious to her and invited her to his hunting-palace at fontainebleau.\n",
      "while she had been winning triumphs of sarcasm the infatuated monaldeschi had gradually come to suspect, and then to know, that his royal mistress  ----  no longer true to him.\n",
      "he had been supplanted in her favor by another italian, one sentanelli, who  ----  the captain of her guard.\n",
      "he did not let the queen know of h ----  discovery; nor did he, like a man, send a challenge to sentanelli.\n",
      "instead he began by betraying her secrets to oliver cromwell, with whom she had tried to establ ---- h a correspondence.\n",
      "again, imitating the hand and seal of sentanelli, he set in circulation a series of the most scandalous and insulting letters about chr ---- tina.\n",
      "by this treacherous trick he hoped to end the relations between his rival and the queen; but when the letters  ----  carried to christina she instantly recognized their true source.\n",
      "she saw that she  ----  betrayed by her former favorite and that he had taken a revenge which might seriously compromise her.\n",
      "this led to a tragedy, of which the facts  ----  long obscure.\n",
      "they were c ---- fully recorded, however, by the queen's household chaplain, father le bel; and there is also a narrative written by one marco antonio conti, which confirms the story.\n",
      "both  ----  published privately in 1865, with notes by louis lacour.\n",
      "the narration of the priest  ----  dreadful in its simplicity and minuteness of detail.\n",
      "it may be summed up briefly here, because it  ----  the testimony of an eye-witness who knew christina.\n",
      "christina, with the marquis and a large retinue,  ----  at fontainebleau in november, 1657. a little after midnight, when all was still, the priest, father le bel, was aroused and ordered to go at once to the galerie des cerfs, or hall of stags, in another part of the palace.\n",
      "when he asked why, he  ----  told: \"it is by the order of her majesty the swedish queen.\"\n",
      "the priest, wondering, hurried on h ----  garments.\n",
      "on reaching the gloomy hall he saw the marqu ----  monaldeschi, evidently in great agitation, and at the end of the corridor the queen in somber robes.\n",
      " ---- side the queen, as if awaiting orders, stood three figures, who could with some difficulty be made out as three soldiers of her guard.\n",
      "the queen motioned to father le  ---- l and asked him for a packet which she had given him for safe-keeping some little time before.\n",
      "in it  ----  letters and other documents, which, with a steely glance, she displayed to monaldeschi.\n",
      "he was confused by the sight of them and by the incisive words in which christina showed how he had both insulted her and had tried to shift the bl ---- e upon sentanelli.\n",
      "he fell at the queen's feet and wept piteously, begging for pardon, only to be met by the cold answer: \"you  ----  my subject and a traitor to me.\n",
      "marquis, you must prep ----  to die!\"\n",
      "then she turned away and left the hall, in spite of the cries of monaldeschi, to whom she merely added the advice that he should make h ----  peace with god by confessing to father le bel.\n",
      "after she had gone the marqu ----  fell into a torrent of self-exculpation and cried for mercy.\n",
      "the three armed men drew near and urged him to confess for the good of h ----  soul.\n",
      "they seemed to have no malice against him, but to feel that they must o ---- y the orders given them.\n",
      "at the frantic urging of the marqu ----  their leader even went to the queen to ask whether she would relent; but he returned shaking his head, and said: \"marquis, you must die.\"\n",
      "father le bel undertook a like mission, but returned with the message that there  ----  no hope.\n",
      "so the marqu ----  made his confession in french and latin, but even then he hoped; for he did not wait to receive absolution, but begged still further for delay or pardon.\n",
      "the absolution  ----  pronounced; and, following it, one of the guards slashed the marquis across the forehead.\n",
      "he stumbled and fell forward, making signs as if to ask that he might have h ----  throat cut.\n",
      "but his throat  ----  partly protected by a coat of mail, so that three or four strokes delivered there had slight effect.\n",
      "finally, however, a long, narrow sword  ----  thrust into his side, after which the marquis made no sound.\n",
      "father le bel at once left the galerie des cerfs and went into the queen's apartment, with the smell of blood in h ----  nostrils.\n",
      " ----  she not still queen over all who had voluntarily become members of her suite?\n",
      "th ----  had been agreed to in her act of abdication.\n",
      "wherever she set her foot, there, over her own, she  ----  still a monarch, with full power to punish traitors at her will.\n",
      "th ----  power she had exercised, and with justice.\n",
      "what mattered it that she  ----  in france?\n",
      "she  ----  queen as truly as louis xiv.\n",
      " ----  king.\n",
      "the story  ----  not long in getting out, but the truth was not wholly known until a much later day.\n",
      "it  ----  said that sentanelli had slapped the marquis in a fit of jealousy, though some added that it was done with the connivance of the queen.\n",
      "king louis, the incarnation of absolutism, knew the truth, but he  ----  slow to act.\n",
      "he sympathized with the theory of chr ---- tina's sovereignty.\n",
      "it  ----  only after a time that word was sent to christina that she must leave fontainebleau.\n",
      "this  ----  the most striking episode in all the strange story of her private life.\n",
      "she then sought the vacant throne of poland; but the pol ---- h nobles, who desired a weak ruler for their own purposes, made another choice.\n",
      "so at last she returned to rome, where the pope received her with a splendid procession and granted her twelve thousand crowns a year to make up for her lessened swed ---- h revenue.\n",
      "from th ----  time she lived a life which she made interesting by her patronage of learning and exciting by her rather unseemly quarrels with cardinals and even with the pope.\n",
      "she d ---- d to criticize the pontiff, who merely smiled and said: \"she is a woman!\"\n",
      "on the whole, the end of her life  ----  pleasant.\n",
      "she  ----  much admired for her sagacity in politics.\n",
      "her words  ----  listened to at every court in europe.\n",
      "she annotated the classics, she made beautiful collections, and she was regarded as a privileged person whose acts no one took  ---- iss.\n",
      "she died at fifty-three, and  ----  buried in st. peter's.\n",
      "she  ----  bred a man, she was almost a son to her great father; and yet, instead of the sonorous epitaph that is inscribed beside her tomb, perhaps a truer one would be the words of the vexed pope: \"e donna!\"\n",
      "john  ----  undoubtedly the most unpopular.\n",
      "the impetuous yet far-seeing henry ii., with the other two great warriors, edward i. and edward iii., and willi ----  of orange, did most for the foundation and development of england's constitutional law.\n",
      "and the woman ---- h henry vi., have been contemptible.\n",
      "hard-working, useful kings have been henry vii., the georges, willi ----  iv., and especially the last edward.\n",
      "if we consider those monarchs who have in some curious way touched the popular fancy without reference to their virtues we must go back to richard of the lion heart, who saw but little of england, yet  ----  the best essentially english king, and to henry v., gallant soldier and conqueror of france.\n",
      "had a warm place in the affection of h ----  countrymen, few of whom saw him near at hand, but most of whom made him a sort of regal incarnation of john bull--wrestling and tilting and boxing, eating great joints of beef, and staying his thirst with flagons of ale--a big, healthy, masterful animal, in fact, who gratified the national love of splendor and stood up manfully in his struggle with the pope.\n",
      "but if you look for something more than ordinary popularity--something that belongs to sentiment and makes men willing to become martyrs for a royal cause--we must find these  ---- ong the stuart kings.\n",

      "to make herself of small account as comp ---- d with the one she loves; to give freely of herself, even though she may receive nothing in return; to suffer, and yet to feel an inner poignant joy in all this suffering--here is a most wonderful trait of womanhood.\n",
      "perhaps it  ----  akin to the maternal instinct; for to the mother, after she has felt the throb of a new life within her, there is no sacrifice so great and no anguish so keen that she will not welcome it as the outward sign and evidence of her illimitable love.\n",
      "in most women th ----  spirit of self-sacrifice is checked and kept within ordinary bounds by the circumstances of their lives.\n",
      "in many small things they do yield and they do suffer; yet it  ----  not in yielding and in suffering that they find their deepest joy.\n",
      "there  ----  some, however, who seem to have been born with an abnormal capacity for enduring hardship and mental anguish; so that by a sort of contradiction they find their happiness in sorrow.\n",
      "such women  ----  endowed with a remarkable degree of sensibility.\n",
      "in moments of grief and d ---- appointment, and even of despair, there steals over them a sort of melancholy pleasure.\n",
      "it  ----  as if they loved dim lights and mournful music and scenes full of sad suggestion.\n",

      "if anything goes wrong with them, they  ----  sure that this is only the beginning of something even worse.\n",
      "the music of their lives  ----  written in a minor key.\n",
      "it believes that they  ----  \"fond of making scenes.\"\n",
      "it regards as an affectation something that  ----  really instinctive and inevitable.\n",
      "unless such women  ----  beautiful and young and charming they are treated badly; and this is often true in spite of all their natural attractiveness, for they seem to court ill usage as if they were saying frankly: \"come, take us!\n",
      "do not  ----  constant or generous or even kind.\n",
      "but, none the less, in our sorrow there will  ----  sweetness, and even in our abasement we shall feel a sort of triumph.\"\n",
      "in history there is one woman who stands out conspicuously as a type of her melancholy sisterhood, one whose life  ----  full of disappointment even when she was most successful, and of indignity even when she was most sought after and admired.\n",
      "this woman was adrienne lecouvreur, f ---- ous in the annals of the stage, and still more famous in the annals of unrequited--or, at any rate, unhappy--love.\n",
      "her story  ----  linked with that of a man no less remarkable than herself, a hero of chivalry, a marvel of courage, of fascination, and of irresponsibility.\n",
      "adrienne lecouvreur--her n ---- e was originally couvreur--was born toward the end of the seventeenth century in the little french village of damery, not far from rheims, where her aunt was a laundress and her father a hatter in a small way.\n",
      "of her mother, who died in childbirth, we know nothing; but her father  ----  a man of gloomy and ungovernable temper, breaking out into violent fits of passion, in one of which, long afterward, he died, raving and yelling like a maniac.\n",
      "adrienne was brought up at the wash-tub, and bec ---- e accustomed to a wandering life, in which she went from one town to another.\n",
      "what she had inherited from her mother is, of course, not known; but she had all her father's strangely pessimistic temper, softened only by the fact that she  ----  a girl.\n",
      "from her earliest years she  ----  unhappy; yet her unhappiness was largely of her own choosing.\n",
      "other girls of her own station met life cheerfully, worked away from dawn till dusk, and then had their moments of  ---- usement, and even jollity, with their companions, after the fashion of all children.\n",
      "but adrienne lecouvreur  ----  unhappy because she chose to be.\n",
      "it  ----  not the wash-tub that made her so, for she had been born to it; nor was it the half-mad outbreaks of her father, because to her, at least, he was not unkind.\n",
      "her d ---- content sprang from her excessive sensibility.\n",
      "her intelligence  ----  great.\n",
      " ---- bition was awakened in her before she was ten years of age, when she began to learn and to recite poems--learning them, as has been said, \"between the wash-tub and the ironing-board,\" and reciting them to the admiration of older and wiser people than she.\n",
      "even at ten she was a very beautiful child, with great l ---- bent eyes, an exquisite complexion, and a lovely form, while she had the further gift of a voice that thrilled the listener and, when she chose, brought tears to every eye.\n",
      "she was, indeed, a natural elocutionist, knowing by instinct all those modulations of tone and varied cadences which go to the he ---- r's heart.\n",
      "it was very like adrienne lecouvreur to memorize only such poems as  ----  mournful, just as in after life she could win success upon the stage only in tragic parts.\n",
      "she would repeat with a sort of ecstasy the pathetic poems that  ----  then admired; and she was soon able to give up her menial work, because many people asked her to their houses so that they could listen to the divinely beautiful voice charged with the emotion which was always at her command.\n",
      "when she  ----  thirteen her father moved to paris, where she was placed at school--a very humble school in a very humble quarter of the city.\n",
      "a num ---- r of children and young people, probably influenced by adrienne, formed themselves into a theatrical company from the pure love of acting.\n",
      "a friendly grocer let them have an empty store-room for their performances, and in th ----  store-room adrienne lecouvreur first acted in a tragedy by corneille, assuming the part of leading woman.\n",
      "her genius for the stage  ----  like the genius of napoleon for war.\n",
      "she had never been inside of any theater; and yet she delivered the magnificent lines with all the power and fire and effectiveness of a most accompl ---- hed actress.\n",
      "people thronged to see her and to feel the tempest of emotion which shook her as she sustained her part, which for the moment  ----  as real to her as life itself.\n",

      "du gue, c ---- e out of curiosity and was fascinated by the little actress.\n",
      "from that moment the f ---- e of adrienne spread throughout all paris.\n",
      "the courtyard  ----  crowded by gentlemen and ladies, by people of distinction from the court, and at last even by actors and actresses from the comedie franchise.\n",
      "it is, in fact, a remarkable tribute to adrienne that in her thirteenth year she excited so much jealousy  ---- ong the actors of the comedie that they evoked the law against her.\n",
      "hence legal proceedings were begun, and the most f ---- ous actresses in paris talked of having these clever children imprisoned!\n",
      "upon th ----  the company sought the precincts of the temple, where no legal warrant could be served without the express order of the king himself.\n",
      "finally, as the other children  ----  not geniuses, but merely boys and girls in search of fun, the little company broke up.\n",
      "its success, however, had determined for ever the c ---- er of adrienne.\n",
      "with her beautiful face, her lithe and exquisite figure, her golden voice, and her instinctive art, it  ----  plain enough that her future lay upon the stage; and so at fourteen or fifteen she began where most actresses leave off--accomplished and attractive, and having had a practical training in her profession.\n",
      "diderot, in that s ---- e century, observed that the truest actor is one who does not feel his part at all, but produces his effects by intellectual effort and intelligent observation.\n",

      "to some extent it was the theory of garrick and fechter and edwin booth; though it was rejected by the two keans, and by edwin forrest, who entered so throughly into the character which he assumed, and who let loose such tremendous bursts of passion that other actors dreaded to support him on the stage in such parts as spartacus and met ---- ora.\n"

      "an actor, one clavel, would have married her, but she would not accept h ----  offer.\n",
      "a magistrate in strasburg promised marriage; and then, when she was about to accept him, he wrote to her that he was going to yield to the wishes of his f ---- ily and make a more advantageous alliance.\n",
      "and so she was alternately caressed and repulsed--a mere plaything; and yet this was probably all that she really needed at the time--something to stir her, something to make her mournful or indignant or ash ---- ed.\n",
      "it  ----  inevitable that at last adrienne lecouvreur should appear in paris.\n",
      "she had won such renown throughout the provinces that even those who  ----  intensely jealous of her were obliged to give her due consideration.\n",
      "in 1717, when she was in her twenty-fifth year, she bec ---- e a member of the comedie franchise.\n",
      "she was one of the glories of paris, for she bec ---- e the fashion outside the theater.\n",
      "for the first time the great classic plays  ----  given, not in the monotonous singsong which had become a sort of theatrical convention, but with all the fire and naturalness of life.\n",
      " ----  the fashion, mlle.\n",
      "her salon  ----  thronged by men and women of rank.\n",
      "to be invited to her dinners  ----  almost like receiving a decoration from the king.\n",
      "she ought to have  ----  happy, for she had reached the summit of her profession and something more.\n",
      "yet still she  ----  unhappy.\n",
      "in all her letters one finds a plaintive tone, a little moaning sound that shows how slightly her nature had  ----  changed.\n",
      "an english peer--lord peterborough--not realizing that she  ----  different from other actresses of that loose-lived age, said to her coarsely at his first introduction: \"come now!\n",
      "the remark  ----  characteristic of the time.\n",
      "yet adrienne had learned at least one thing, and that was the discontent which c ---- e from light affairs.\n",
      "if she could not love with her entire being, if she could not give all that  ----  in her to be given, whether of her heart or mind or soul, then she would love no more at all.\n",
      "at this time there c ---- e to paris a man remarkable in his own century, and one who afterward became almost a hero of romance.\n",
      "this was maurice, comte de saxe, as the french called him, his german n ---- e and title being moritz, graf von sachsen, while we usually term him, in english, marshal saxe.\n",
      "maurice de saxe  ----  now, in 1721, entering his twenty-fifth year.\n",
      "already, though so young, his c ---- er had been a strange one; and it was destined to be still more remarkable.\n",
      "he  ----  the natural son of duke augustus ii.\n",
      "of saxony, who later bec ---- e king of poland, and who is known in history as augustus the strong.\n",
      "augustus  ----  a giant in stature and in strength, handsome, daring, unscrupulous, and yet extremely fascinating.\n",
      "his life  ----  one of revelry and fighting and display.\n",
      "when in h ----  cups he would often call for a horseshoe and twist it into a knot with his powerful fingers.\n",
      "many were his mistresses; but the one for whom he c ---- d the most was a beautiful and high-spirited swedish girl of rank, aurora von konigsmarck.\n",
      "she  ----  descended from a rough old field-marshal who in the thirty years' war had slashed and sacked and pillaged and plundered to his heart's content.\n",
      "their son, maurice de saxe, inherited everything that was good in his p ---- nts, and a great deal that was less commendable.\n",
      "as a mere child of twelve he had insisted on joining the army of prince eugene, and had seen rough service in a very strenuous c ---- paign.\n",
      "\"young man,\" he said, \"you must not m ---- take mere recklessness for valor.\"\n",
      "before he  ----  twenty he had attained the stature and strength of his royal father; and, to prove it, he in his turn called for a horseshoe, which he twisted and broke in his fingers.\n",
      "he fought on the side of the russians and poles, and again against the turks, everywhere displaying high courage and also genius as a commander; for he never lost his self-possession  ---- id the very blackest danger, but possessed, as carlyle says, \"vigilance, foresight, and sagacious precaution.\"\n",
      "exceedingly handsome, maurice  ----  a master of all the arts that pleased, with just a touch of roughness, which seemed not unfitting in so gallant a soldier.\n",
      "h ----  troops adored him and would follow wherever he might choose to lead them; for he exercised over these rude men a magnetic power resembling that of napoleon in after years.\n",
      "in private life he  ----  a hard drinker and fond of every form of pleasure.\n",
      "having no fortune of his own, a marriage  ----  arranged for him with the countess von loben, who was immensely wealthy; but in three years he had squandered all her money upon his pleasures, and had, moreover, got himself heavily in debt.\n",
      "it was at this time that he first c ---- e to paris to study military tactics.\n",
      "he had fought hard against the french in the wars that  ----  now ended; but his chivalrous bearing, his handsome person, and his reckless joviality made him at once a universal favorite in paris.\n",
      "to the perfumed courtiers, with their laces and lovelocks and mincing ways, maurice de saxe c ---- e as a sort of knight of old--jovial, daring, pleasure-loving.\n",
      "even his broken french  ----  held to be quite charming; and to see him break a horseshoe with his fingers threw every one into raptures.\n",
      "no wonder, then, that he  ----  welcomed in the very highest circles.\n",
      "almost at once he attracted the notice of the princesse de conti, a  ---- autiful woman of the blood royal.\n",
      "of her it has been said that she was \"the personification of a kiss, the incarnation of an embrace, the ideal of a dre ----  of love.\"\n",
      "her chestnut hair was tinted with little gle ---- s of gold.\n",
      "her eyes  ----  violet black.\n",
      "her complexion  ----  dazzling.\n",
      "but by the king's orders she had been forced to marry a hunchback--a man whose very limbs were so weakened by disease and evil living that they would often fail to support him, and he would fall to the ground, a writhing, scre ---- ing mass of ill-looking flesh.\n",
      "it  ----  not surprising that his lovely wife should have shuddered much at his abuse of her and still more at his grotesque endearments.\n",
      "by a skilful trick he led the prince de conti to invade the sleeping-room of the princess, with servants, declaring that she  ----  not alone.\n",
      "the charge proved quite untrue, and so she left her husband, having won the sympathy of her own world, which held that she had  ----  insulted.\n",
      "but it  ----  not she who was destined to win and hold the love of maurice de saxe.\n",
      "not long after his appearance in the french capital he  ----  invited to dine with the \"queen of paris,\" adrienne lecouvreur.\n",
      "he knew her previous h ---- tory.\n",
      "he knew that she was very much of a soiled dove; but when he met her these two natures, so utterly dissimilar, leaped together, as it  ---- , through the indescribable attraction of opposites.\n",
      "he  ----  big and powerful; she was small and fragile.\n",
      "he  ----  merry, and full of quips and jests; she was reserved and melancholy.\n",
      "at one of their earliest meetings the climax c ---- e.\n",
      "saxe  ----  not the man to hesitate; while she already, in her thoughts, had made a full surrender.\n",
      "in one great sweep he gathered her into h ----  arms.\n",
      "it appe ---- d to her as if no man had ever laid his hand upon her until that moment.\n",
      "it was, indeed, the very first love which in her checkered career was really worthy of the n ---- e.\n",
      "she had supposed that all such things  ----  passed and gone, that her heart was closed for ever, that she was invulnerable; and yet here she found herself clinging about the neck of this impetuous soldier and showing him all the shy fondness and the unselfish devotion of a young girl.\n",
      "from th ----  instant adrienne lecouvreur never loved another man and never even looked at any other man with the slightest interest.\n",
      "for nine long years the two  ----  bound together, though there were strange events to ruffle the surface of their love.\n",
      "maurice de saxe had  ----  sired by a king.\n",
      "he had the lofty  ---- bition to be a king himself, and he felt the stirrings of that genius which in after years was to make him a great soldier, and to win the brilliant victory of fontenoy, which to this very day the french are never tired of recalling.\n",
      "already lou ----  xv.\n",
      "had made him a marshal of france; and a certain restlessness c ---- e over him.\n",
      "he loved adrienne; yet he felt that to remain in the enjoyment of her witcheries ought not to be the whole of a man's c ---- er.\n",
      "maurice de saxe  ----  eager to secure its throne, which would make him at least semi-royal and the chief of a principality.\n",
      "he hastened thither and found that money  ----  needed to carry out his plans.\n",
      "the widow of the late duke--the grand duchess anna, niece of peter the great, and later empress of russia--as soon as she had met th ----  dazzling genius, offered to help him to acquire the duchy if he would only marry her.\n",
      "still another woman of high rank, the grand duchess elizabeth of russia, peter the great's daughter, made him very much the s ---- e proposal.\n",
      "both of these imperial women might well have attracted a man like maurice de saxe, had he been wholly fancy-free, for the second of them inherited the high spirit and the genius of the great peter, while the first  ----  a pleasure-seeking princess, resembling some of those roman empresses who loved to stoop that they might conquer.\n",
      "she is described as indolent and sensual, and she once decl ---- d that the chief good in the world was love.\n",
      "she  ----  unquestionably endowed with the magnetic gift of winning hearts.\n",
      "adrienne, who  ----  left behind in paris, knew very little of what was going on.\n",
      "only two things  ----  absolutely clear to her.\n",
      "one  ----  that if her lover secured the duchy he must be parted from her.\n",
      "the other was that without money his  ---- bition must be thwarted, and that he would then return to her.\n",
      "here  ----  a test to try the soul of any woman.\n",
      "come what might, maurice should  ----  duke of courland, even though she lost him.\n",
      "this incident shows how absolutely she  ----  his.\n",
      "but in fact, because of various intrigues, he failed of election to the ducal throne of courland, and he returned to adrienne with all her money spent, and without even the grace, at first, to show h ----  gratitude.\n",
      "he stormed and raged over h ----  ill luck.\n",
      "in one of her letters she bursts out with the pitiful excl ---- ation: i am distracted with rage and anguish.\n",
      " ----  it not natural to cry out against such treachery?\n",
      "th ----  man surely ought to know me--he ought to love me.\n",
      "what  ----  we--what are we?\n",
      "but still she could not give him up, nor could he give her up, though there  ----  frightful scenes between them--times when he cruelly reproached her and when her native melancholy deepened into outbursts of despair.\n",
      "finally there occurred an incident which  ----  more or less obscure in parts.\n",
      "she set herself to win it openly and without any sense of sh ---- e.\n",
      "maurice himself at times, when the tears of adrienne proved wear ---- ome, flirted with the duchess.\n",
      "yet, even so, adrienne held the first place in h ----  heart, and her rival knew it.\n",
      "there  ----  to be a gala performance of racine's great tragedy, \"phedre,\" with adrienne, of course, in the title-role.\n",
      "the duchesse de bouillon sent a large number of her lackeys with orders to h ---- s and jeer, and, if possible, to break off the play.\n",
      "malignantly delighted with her plan, the duchess arrayed herself in jewels and took her seat in a conspicuous stage-box, where she could watch the coming storm and gloat over the d ---- comfiture of her rival.\n",
      "when the curtain rose, and when adrienne appe ---- d as phedre, an uproar began.\n",
      "it  ----  clear to the great actress that a plot had been devised against her.\n",
      "in an instant her whole soul  ----  afire.\n",
      "the queen-like majesty of her  ---- aring compelled silence throughout the house.\n",
      "even the hired lackeys  ----  overawed by it.\n",
      "then adrienne moved swiftly across the stage and fronted her enemy, speaking into her very face the three insulting lines which c ---- e to her at that moment of the play: i am not of those women void of shame, who, savoring in crime the joys of peace, harden their faces till they cannot blush!\n",
      "adrienne had won, for the woman who had tried to sh ---- e her rose in trepidation and hurried from the theater.\n",
      "but the end  ----  not yet.\n",
      "those  ----  evil times, when dark deeds were committed by the great almost with impunity.\n",
      "secret poisoning  ----  a common trade.\n",
      "to remove a rival  ----  as usual a thing in the eighteenth century as to snub a rival is usual in the twentieth.\n",
      "not long afterward, on the night of march 15, 1730, adrienne lecouvreur  ----  acting in one of voltaire's plays with all her power and instinctive art when suddenly she was seized with the most frightful pains.\n",
      "her anguish  ----  obvious to every one who saw her, and yet she had the courage to go through her part.\n",
      "then she fainted and  ----  carried home.\n",
      "four days later she died, and her death was no less dr ---- atic than her life had been.\n",
      "her lover and two friends of his  ----  with her, and also a jesuit priest.\n",
      "he declined to administer extreme unction unless she would decl ----  that she repented of her theatrical career.\n",
      "she stubbornly refused, since she believed that to be the greatest actress of her time  ----  not a sin.\n",

      "then c ---- e the final moment.\n",
      "\"weary and revolting against th ----  death, this destiny, she stretched her arms with one of the old lovely gestures toward a bust which stood near by and cried--her last cry of passion: \"'there is my world, my hope--yes, and my god!'\"\n",
      "the bust  ----  one of maurice de saxe.\n",
      "the story of prince charles edward stuart the royal f ---- ilies of europe are widely known, yet not all of them are equally renowned.\n",
      "thus, the house of romanoff, although comparatively young, stands out to the mind with a sort of barbaric power, more vividly than the austrian house of hapsburg, which is the oldest reigning f ---- ily in europe, tracing its beginnings backward until they are lost in the dark ages.\n",
      "the hohenzollerns of prussia  ----  comparatively modern, so far as concerns their royalty.\n",
      "the offshoots of the bourbons carry on a very proud tradition in the person of the king of spain, although france, which has been ruled by so many members of the f ---- ily, will probably never again behold a bourbon king.\n",
      "the deposed braganzas bear a n ---- e which is ancient, but which has a somewhat tinsel sound.\n",
      "the bonapartes, of course,  ----  merely parvenus, and they have had the good taste to pretend to no antiquity of birth.\n",
      "the first napoleon, dining at a table full of monarchs, when he heard one of them deferentially alluding to the bonaparte f ---- ily as being very old and noble, exclaimed: \"pish!\n",
      "my nobility dates from the day of m ---- ngo!\"\n",
      "and the third napoleon, in announcing h ----  coming marriage with mlle.\n",
      "de montijo, used the very word \"parvenu\" in speaking of himself and of his f ---- ily.\n",
      "his frankness won the hearts of the french people and helped to reconcile them to a marriage in which the bride was b ---- ly noble.\n",
      "in english history there are two great n ---- es to conjure by, at least to the imaginative.\n",
      "one  ----  plantagenet, which seems to contain within itself the very essence of all that is patrician, magnificent, and royal.\n",
      "it calls to memory at once the lion-hearted richard, whose short reign  ----  replete with romance in england and france and austria and the holy land.\n",
      "but perhaps a n ---- e of greater influence is that which links the royal family of britain today with the traditions of the past, and which summons up legend and story and great deeds of history.\n",
      "this is the n ---- e of stuart, about which a whole volume might be written to recall its suggestions and its reminiscences.\n",
      "the first stuart (then stewart) of whom anything is known got his n ---- e from the title of \"steward of scotland,\" which remained in the family for generations, until the sixth of the line, by marriage with princess marjory bruce, acquired the scottish crown.\n",
      "that was in the early years of the fourteenth century; and finally, after the death of elizabeth of england, her rival's son, j ---- es vi.\n",
      "of scotland and i. of england, united under one crown two kingdoms that had so long  ----  at almost constant war.\n",
      "it is almost characteristic of the scot that, having small territory, little wealth, and a seat  ---- ong his peers that is almost ostentatiously humble, he should bit by bit absorb the possessions of all the rest and become their master.\n",
      "surely, the proud tudors, whose line ended with elizabeth, must have despised the \"stewards,\" whose kingdom  ----  small and bleak and cold, and who could not control their own vassals.\n",
      "one can imagine also, with sir walter scott, the haughty nobles of the english court sneering covertly at the awkward, sh ---- bling james, pedant and bookworm.\n",
      "nevertheless, his diplomacy  ----  almost as good as that of elizabeth herself; and, though he did some foolish things, he was very far from being a fool.\n",
      "in his appearance j ---- es was not unlike abraham lincoln--an unkingly figure; and yet, like lincoln, when occasion required it he could rise to the dignity which makes one feel the presence of a king.\n",
      "he  ----  the only stuart who lacked anything in form or feature or external grace.\n",
      "his son, charles i.,  ----  perhaps one of the worst rulers that england has ever had; yet his uprightness of life, his melancholy yet handsome face, his graceful bearing, and the strong religious element in his character, together with the fact that he was put to death after being treacherously surrendered to his enemies--all these have combined to make almost a saint of him.\n",
      "there  ----  englishmen to-day who speak of him as \"the martyr king,\" and who, on certain days of the year, say prayers that beg the lord's forgiveness because of charles's execution.\n",
      "the members of the so-called league of the white rose, founded to perpetuate english allegiance to the direct line of stuarts, do many things that  ----  quite absurd.\n",
      "they refuse to pray for the present king of england and profess to think that the princess mary of bavaria  ----  the true ruler of great britain.\n",
      "all this represents that trace of sentiment which lingers  ---- ong the english to-day.\n",
      "they feel that the stuarts were the last kings of england to rule by the grace of god rather than by the grace of parli ---- ent.\n",
      "as a matter of fact, the present reigning f ---- ily in england is glad to derive its ancient strain of royal blood through a stuart--descended on the distaff side from james i., and winding its way through hanover.\n",
      "th ----  sentiment for the stuarts is a thing entirely apart from reason and belongs to the realm of poetry and romance; yet so strong is it that it has shown itself in the most inconsistent fashion.\n",
      "for instance, sir walter scott  ----  a devoted adherent of the house of hanover.\n",
      "visited edinburgh, scott  ----  completely carried away by his loyal enthusiasm.\n",
      "he could not see that the man before him  ----  a drunkard and braggart.\n",
      "he snatched up a wine-glass from which george had just  ----  drinking and carried it away to be an object of reverence for ever after.\n",
      "nevertheless, in h ----  heart, and often in his speech, scott seemed to be a high tory, and even a jacobite.\n",
      "there  ----  precedents for this.\n",
      "the empress eugenie used often to say with a laugh that she  ----  the only true royalist at the imperial court of france.\n",
      "that  ----  well enough for her in her days of flightiness and frivolity.\n",
      "no one, however, accused queen victoria of being frivolous, and she  ----  not supposed to have a strong sense of humor.\n",
      "none the less, after listening to the skirling of the bagpipes and to the romantic ballads which  ----  sung in scotland she is said to have remarked with a sort of sigh: \"whenever i hear those ballads i feel that england belongs really to the stuarts!\"\n",
      "before queen victoria  ----  born, when all the sons of george iii.\n",
      "were childless, the duke of kent was urged to marry, so that he might have a f ---- ily to continue the succession.\n",
      "in resenting the suggestion he said many things, and  ---- ong them this was the most striking: \"why don't you call the stuarts back to england?\n",
      "from this marriage c ---- e victoria, who had the sacred drop of stuart blood which gave england to the hanoverians; and she was to redeem the blunders and tyrannies of both houses.\n",
      "the fascination of the stuarts, which has been carried overseas to  ---- erica and the british dominions, probably began with the striking history of mary queen of scots.\n",
      "her brilliancy and boldness and beauty, and especially the pathos of her end, have made us see only her intense womanliness, which in her own day  ----  the first thing that any one observed in her.\n",
      "one regrets his death upon the scaffold, even though his execution  ----  necessary to the growth of freedom.\n",
      "many people  ----  no less fascinated by charles ii., that very different type, with his gaiety, his good-fellowship, and his easy-going ways.\n",
      "it is not surprising that his people, most of whom never saw him,  ----  very fond of him, and did not know that he was selfish, a loose liver, and almost a vassal of the king of france.\n",
      "so it is not strange that the stuarts, with all their arts and graces,  ----  very hard to displace.\n",
      "j ---- es ii., with the aid of the french, fought hard before the british troops in ireland broke the backs of both his armies and sent him into exile.\n",
      "again in 1715--an episode perpetuated in thackeray's dr ---- atic story of henry esmond--came the son of james to take advantage of the vacancy caused by the death of queen anne.\n",
      "but it  ----  perhaps to this claimant's son, the last of the militant stuarts, that more chivalrous feeling has been given than to any other.\n",
      "to his followers he  ----  the young chevalier, the true prince of wales; to his enemies, the whigs and the hanoverians, he was \"the pretender.\"\n",
      "one of the most romantic chapters of h ---- tory is the one which tells of that last brilliant dash which he made upon the coast of scotland, landing with but a few attendants and rejecting the support of a french army.\n",
      "\"it  ----  not with foreigners,\" he said, \"but with my own loyal subjects, that i wish to regain the kingdom for my father.\"\n",
      "it  ----  a daring deed, and the spectacular side of it has been often commemorated, especially in sir walter scott's waverley.\n",
      "there we see the gallant prince moving through a sort of military panor ---- a.\n",
      "most of the british troops  ----  absent in flanders, and the few regiments that could be mustered to meet him were appalled by the ferocity and reckless courage of the highlanders, who leaped down like wildcats from their hills and flung themselves with dirk and sword upon the british cannon.\n",
      "we see sir john cope retiring at falkirk, and the aston ---- hing victory of prestonpans, where disciplined british troops fled in dismay through the morning mist, leaving artillery and supplies behind them.\n",
      "it  ----  scott again who shows us the prince, master of edinburgh for a time, while the white rose of stuart royalty held once more the ancient keep above the scottish capital.\n",
      "then we see the chevalier pressing southward into england, where he hoped to ra ---- e an english army to support his own.\n",
      "but his highlanders c ---- d nothing for england, and the english--even the catholic gentry--would not rise to support his cause.\n",
      "handsome, high-tempered, and brave, he could also control h ----  fiery spirit and listen to advice, however unpalatable it might be.\n",
      "the time  ----  favorable.\n",
      "the brit ---- h troops had been defeated on the continent by marshal saxe, of whom i have already written, and by marshal d'estrees.\n",
      " ----  a king whom few respected.\n",
      "he grossly ill-treated h ----  wife.\n",
      "it  ----  said that on one occasion, in a fit of temper, he actually kicked the prime minister.\n",
      "not many felt any personal loyalty to him, and he spent most of h ----  time away from england in his other domain of hanover.\n",
      "but precisely here was a reason why englishmen  ----  willing to put up with him.\n",
      "as between him and the brilliant stuart there would have been no hesitation had the choice been merely one of men; but it  ----  believed that the return of the stuarts meant the return of something like absolute government, of taxation without sanction of law, and of religious persecution.\n",
      "under the hanoverian george the engl ---- h people had begun to exercise a considerable measure of self-government.\n",
      "sharp opposition in parli ---- ent compelled him time and again to yield; and when he was in hanover the english were left to work out the problem of free government.\n",
      "hence, although prince charles edward fascinated all who met him, and although a small army was raised for his support, still the unromantic, common-sense englishmen felt that things  ----  better than in the days gone by, and most of them refused to take up arms for the cause which sentimentally they favored.\n",
      "therefore, although the chevalier stirred all england and sent a thrill through the officers of state in london, h ----  soldiers gradually deserted, and the scots insisted on returning to their own country.\n",
      "although the stuart troops reached a point as far south as derby, they  ----  soon pushed backward into scotland, pursued by an army of about nine thousand men under the duke of cumberland, son of george ii.\n",
      "cumberland was no soldier; he had been soundly beaten by the french on the f ---- ous field of fontenoy.\n",
      "yet he had firmness and a sort of overmastering brutality, which, with disciplined troops and abundant artillery,  ----  sufficient to win a victory over the untrained highlanders.\n",
      "when the battle c ---- e five thousand of these mountaineers went roaring along the english lines, with the chevalier himself at their head.\n",
      "for a moment there  ----  surprise.\n",
      "the duke of cumberland had  ----  drinking so heavily that he could give no verbal orders.\n",
      "one of his officers, however, is said to have come to him in his tent, where he  ----  trying to play cards.\n",

      "the king and h ----  advisers had many arts, and so had cleopatra.\n",
      "one thing, however, she possessed which struck the balance in her favor, and this  ----  a woman's fascination.\n",
      "according to the story, caesar  ----  unwilling to receive her.\n",
      "there c ---- e into his presence, as he sat in the palace, a group of slaves bearing a long roll of matting, bound carefully and seeming to contain some precious work of art.\n",
      "the slaves made signs that they  ----  bearing a gift to caesar.\n",
      "they did so, and out of the wrapping c ---- e cleopatra--a radiant vision, appealing, irresistible.\n",
      "next morning it bec ---- e known everywhere that cleopatra had remained in caesar's quarters through the night and that her enemies were now his enemies.\n",
      "in desperation they rushed upon his legions, casting aside all pretense of  ---- ity.\n",
      "there ensued a fierce contest, but the revolt  ----  quenched in blood.\n",
      "this  ----  a crucial moment in cleopatra's life.\n",
      "she  ----  queen of egypt, and she had redeemed her kingdom and kept it by her sacrifice.\n",
      "in a sense, her act  ----  one of heroism like that of judith in the tent of holofernes.\n",
      "but  ---- yond all question it changed her character.\n",
      "henceforth she  ----  no longer a mere girl, nor a woman of the ordinary type.\n",
      "in her  ----  blended mental power and that illusive, indefinable gift which is called charm.\n",
      "for cleopatra  ----  never beautiful.\n",
      "signor ferrero seems to think this fact to be discovery of his own, but it  ----  set down by plutarch in a very striking passage written less than a century after cleopatra and antony died.\n",
      "we may quote here what the greek historian said of her: her actual beauty was far from being so remarkable that none could be comp ---- d with her, nor was it such that it would strike your fancy when you saw her first.\n",
      "yet the influence of her presence, if you lingered near her,  ----  irresistible.\n",
      "her attractive personality, joined with the charm of her conversation, and the individual touch that she gave to everything she said or did,  ----  utterly bewitching.\n",
      "it  ----  delightful merely to hear the music of her voice, with which, like an instrument of many strings, she could pass from one language to another.\n",
      "for six years she reigned with great intelligence, keeping order in her dominions, and patronizing with d ---- crimination both arts and letters.\n",
      "caesar had  ----  assassinated, and there ensued a period of civil war.\n",
      "out of it emerged two striking figures which  ----  absolutely contrasted in their character.\n",
      "one  ----  octavian, the adopted son of caesar, a man who, though still quite young and possessed of great ability, was cunning, cold-blooded, and deceitful.\n",
      "the other  ----  antony, a soldier by training, and with all a soldier's bluntness, courage, and lawlessness.\n",
      "the roman world  ----  divided for the time between these two men, antony receiving the government of the east, octavian that of the west.\n",
      "in the year which had preceded th ----  division cleopatra had wavered between the two opposite factions at rome.\n",
      "he was essentially a soldier, of excellent f ---- ily, being related to caesar himself.\n",
      "as a very young man he  ----  exceedingly handsome, and bad companions led him into the pursuit of vicious pleasure.\n",
      "but he  ----  much more than a mere man of pleasure, given over to drinking and to dissipation.\n",
      "men might tell of h ----  escapades, as when he drove about the streets of rome in a common cab, dangling his legs out of the window while he shouted forth drunken songs of revelry.\n",
      "this  ----  not the whole of antony.\n",
      "joining the roman army in syria, he showed himself to be a soldier of great personal bravery, a clever strateg ---- t, and also humane and merciful in the hour of victory.\n",
      "unlike most romans, antony wore a full  ---- ard.\n",
      "his forehead  ----  large, and his nose was of the distinctive roman type.\n",
      "his look  ----  so bold and masculine that people likened him to hercules.\n",
      "his democratic manners ende ---- d him to the army.\n",
      "he wore a plain tunic covered with a large, coarse mantle, and carried a huge sword at h ----  side, despising ostentation.\n",
      "even h ----  faults and follies added to his popularity.\n",
      "he spent money like water, quickly recognizing any daring deed which h ----  legionaries performed.\n",
      "in this respect he  ----  like napoleon; and, like napoleon, he had a vein of florid eloquence which was criticized by literary men, but which went straight to the heart of the private soldier.\n",
      "in a word, he was a powerful, virile, passionate, able man, rough, as  ----  nearly all his countrymen, but strong and true.\n",
      "it was to this general that cleopatra was to answer, and with a firm reliance on the charms which had subdued antony's great commander, caesar, she set out in person for cilicia, in asia minor, sailing up the river cydnus to the place where antony was enc ---- ped with his army.\n",
      "making all allowance for the exaggeration of historians, there can be no doubt that she appeared to him like some dre ---- y vision.\n",
      "her barge  ----  gilded, and was wafted on its way by swelling sails of tyrian purple.\n",
      "the oars which smote the water  ----  of shining silver.\n",
      "as she drew near the roman general's c ---- p the languorous music of flutes and harps breathed forth a strain of invitation.\n",
      "cleopatra herself lay upon a divan set upon the deck of the barge  ---- neath a canopy of woven gold.\n",
      "she  ----  dressed to resemble venus, while girls about her personated nymphs and graces.\n",
      "delicate perfumes diffused themselves from the vessel; and at last, as she drew near the shore, all the people for miles about  ----  gathered there, leaving antony to sit alone in the tribunal where he was dispensing justice.\n",
      "word  ----  brought to him that venus had come to feast with bacchus.\n",
      "with graceful tact she sent him a counter-invitation, and he c ---- e.\n",
      "the magnificence of his reception dazzled the man who had so long known only a soldier's f ---- , or at most the crude entertainments which he had enjoyed in rome.\n",
      "a marvelous display of lights  ----  made.\n",
      "thousands upon thousands of candles shone brilliantly, arranged in squ ---- s and circles; while the banquet itself was one that symbolized the studied luxury of the east.\n",
      "at this time cleopatra  ----  twenty-seven years of age--a period of life which modern physiologists have called the crisis in a woman's growth.\n",
      "she had never really loved before, since she had given herself to caesar, not because she c ---- d for him, but to save her kingdom.\n",
      "she now c ---- e into the presence of one whose manly beauty and strong passions were matched by her own subtlety and appealing charm.\n",
      "almost resentful, he betook himself to the coarse language of the c ---- p.\n",
      "cleopatra, with marvelous adaptability, took her tone from h ---- , and thus in a moment put him at his ease.\n",
      "ferrero, who takes a most unfavorable view of her character and personality, nevertheless explains the secret of her fascination: herself utterly cold and callous, insensitive by nature to the fl ---- e of true devotion, cleopatra was one of those women gifted with an unerring instinct for all the various roads to men's affections.\n",
      "she could  ----  the shrinking, modest girl, too shy to reveal her half-unconscious emotions of jealousy and depression and self-abandonment, or a woman carried away by the sweep of a fiery and uncontrollable passion.\n",
      "she could tickle the esthetic sensibilities of her victims by rich and gorgeous festivals, by the fantastic adornment of her own person and her palace, or by brilliant discussions on literature and art; she could conjure up all their grossest instincts with the vilest obscenities of conversation, with the free and easy jocularity of a woman of the c ---- ps.\n",
      "these last words are far too strong, and they represent only ferrero's personal opinion; yet there is no doubt that she met every mood of antony's so that he bec ---- e enthralled with her at once.\n",
      "no such woman as th ----  had ever cast her eyes on him before.\n",
      "he had a wife at home--a most disreputable wife--so that he c ---- d little for domestic ties.\n",
      "later, out of policy, he made another marriage with the sister of his rival, octavian, but this wife he never c ---- d for.\n",
      "his heart and soul were given up to cleopatra, the woman who could be a comrade in the c ---- p and a fount of tenderness in their hours of dalliance, and who possessed the keen intellect of a man joined to the arts and fascinations of a woman.\n",
      "that there  ----  calculation mingled with her love, no one can doubt.\n",
      "that some calculation also entered into antony's affection  ----  likewise certain.\n",
      "yet this does not affect the truth that each  ----  wholly given to the other.\n",
      "why should it have lessened his love for her to know that she  ----  queen of the richest country in the world--one that could supply his needs, sustain his armies, and gild his triumphs with magnificence?\n",
      "there  ----  many instances in history of regnant queens who loved and yet whose love was not dissociated from the policy of state.\n",
      "such  ----  anne of austria, elizabeth of england, and the unfortunate mary stuart.\n",
      "such, too, we cannot fail to think,  ----  cleopatra.\n",
      "in this time antony was separated from her only during a c ---- paign in the east.\n",
      "in alexandria he ceased to seem a roman citizen and gave himself up wholly to the charms of th ----  enticing woman.\n",
      "many stories  ----  told of their good fellowship and close intimacy.\n",
      "plutarch quotes plato as saying that there  ----  four kinds of flattery, but he adds that cleopatra had a thousand.\n",
      "she  ----  the supreme mistress of the art of pleasing.\n",
      "whether antony  ----  serious or mirthful, she had at the instant some new delight or some new charm to meet his wishes.\n",
      "at every turn she  ----  with him both day and night.\n",
      "with him she threw dice; with him she drank; with him she hunted; and when he exercised himself in arms she  ----  there to admire and applaud.\n",
      "at night the pair would d ---- guise themselves as servants and wander about the streets of alexandria.\n",
      "in fact, more than once they  ----  set upon in the slums and treated roughly by the rabble who did not recognize them.\n",
      "cleopatra  ----  always alluring, always tactful, often humorous, and full of frolic.\n",
      "then c ---- e the shock of antony's final breach with octavian.\n",
      "either antony or h ----  rival must rule the world.\n",
      "cleopatra's lover once more bec ---- e the roman general, and with a great fleet proceeded to the coast of greece, where his enemy was encamped.\n",
      "antony had ra ---- ed a hundred and twelve thousand troops and five hundred ships--a force far superior to that commanded by octavian.\n",
      "cleopatra  ----  there with sixty ships.\n",
      "it seems likely that antony desired to become again the roman, while cleopatra w ---- hed him to thrust rome aside and return to egypt with her, to reign there as an independent king.\n",
      "to her rome  ----  almost a barbarian city.\n"

      "pierre abelard--or, more fully, pierre abelard de palais--was a native of brittany, born in the year 1079. his father was a knight, the lord of the manor; but abelard c ---- d little for the life of a petty noble; and so he gave up his seigniorial rights to his brothers and went forth to become, first of all a student, and then a public lecturer and teacher.\n",

      "his studies suddenly seemed t ---- e and colorless beside the fierce scarlet flame which blazed up in his heart.\n",
      "nevertheless, it  ----  because of these studies and of his great reputation as a scholar that he managed to obtain access to heloise.\n",
      "he flattered her uncle and made a chance proposal that he should himself become an inmate of fulbert's household in order that he might teach th ----  girl of so much promise.\n",
      "such an offer coming from so brilliant a man  ----  joyfully accepted.\n",
      "from that time abelard could v ---- it heloise without restraint.\n",
      "he  ----  her teacher, and the two spent hours together, nominally in the study of greek and hebrew; but doubtless very little was said between them upon such unattractive subjects.\n",
      "on the contrary, with all h ----  wide experience of life, his eloquence, his perfect manners, and his fascination, abelard put forth his power to captivate the senses of a girl still in her teens and quite ignorant of the world.\n",
      "it was then that the pleasures of knowledge, the joys of thought, the emotions of eloquence,  ----  all called into play to charm and move and plunge into a profound and strange intoxication this noble and tender heart which had never known either love or sorrow.... one can imagine that everything helped on the inevitable end.\n",
      "their studies gave them opportunities to see each other freely, and also permitted them to  ----  alone together.\n",
      "then their books lay open  ---- tween them; but either long periods of silence stilled their reading, or else words of deepening intimacy made them forget their studies altogether.\n",
      "the eyes of the two lovers turned from the book to mingle their glances, and then to turn away in a confusion that  ----  conscious.\n",
      "hand would touch hand, app ---- ntly by accident; and when conversation ceased, abelard would often hear the long, quivering sigh which showed the strange, half-frightened, and yet exquisite joy which heloise experienced.\n",
      "it  ----  not long before the girl's heart had been wholly won.\n",
      "transported by her emotion, she met the c ---- sses of her lover with those as unrestrained as his.\n",
      "all was given freely, and even wildly, by heloise; and all was taken by abelard, who afterward himself decl ---- d: \"the pleasure of teaching her to love surpassed the delightful fragrance of all the perfumes in the world.\"\n",
      "yet these two could not always live in a paradise which  ----  entirely their own.\n",
      "the world of par ----  took notice of their close association.\n",

      "he forbade h ----  niece to see her lover any more.\n",
      "but the two could not be separated; and, indeed, there  ----  good reason why they should still cling together.\n",
      "secretly heloise left her uncle's house and fled through the narrow lanes of paris to the dwelling of abelard's sister, denyse, where abelard himself  ----  living.\n",
      "there, presently, the young girl gave birth to a son, who was n ---- ed astrolabe, after an instrument used by astronomers, since both the father and the mother felt that the offspring of so great a love should have no ordinary name.\n",
      "fulbert  ----  furious, and rightly so.\n",
      "h ----  hospitality had been outraged and his niece dishonored.\n",
      "he ins ---- ted that the pair should at once be married.\n",
      "here  ----  revealed a certain weakness in the character of abelard.\n",
      "he consented to the marriage, but ins ---- ted that it should be kept an utter secret.\n",
      "oddly enough, it  ----  heloise herself who objected to becoming the wife of the man she loved.\n",
      "unself ---- hness could go no farther.\n",
      "she saw that,  ----  he to marry her, his advancement in the church would be almost impossible; for, while the very minor clergy sometimes married in spite of the papal bulls, matrimony was becoming a fatal bar to ecclesiastical promotion.\n",
      "and so helo ---- e pleaded pitifully, both with her uncle and with abelard, that there should be no marriage.\n",
      "she would rather bear all manner of d ---- grace than stand in the way of abelard's advancement.\n",
      "how outrageous would it be that you, whom nature created for the universal good, should be devoted to one woman and plunged into such d ---- grace?\n",
      "indeed, every possible effort which another woman in her place would employ to make him marry her she used in order to d ---- suade him.\n",
      "finally, her sweet face stre ---- ing with tears, she uttered that tremendous sentence which makes one really think that she loved him as no other woman ever loved a man.\n",
      "she cried out, in an agony of self-sacrifice: \"i would rather be your m ---- tress than the wife even of an emperor!\"\n",
      "nevertheless, the two  ----  married, and abelard returned to his lecture-room and to his studies.\n",
      "meanwhile, however, the taunts and innuendos directed against heloise so irritated fulbert that he broke his promise of secrecy, and told his friends that abelard and heloise  ----  man and wife.\n",
      "they went to helo ---- e for confirmation.\n",
      "\"i  ----  no wife,\" she said.\n",
      "\"it  ----  not true that abelard has married me.\n",
      "my uncle merely tells you th ----  to save my reputation.\"\n",
      "they asked her whether she would swear to th ---- ; and, without a moment's hesitation, this pure and noble woman took an oath upon the scriptures that there had been no marriage.\n",
      "fulbert  ----  enraged by this.\n",
      "he ill-treated helo ---- e, and, furthermore, he forbade abelard to visit her.\n",
      "the girl, therefore, again left her uncle's house and betook herself to a convent just outside of par ---- , where she assumed the habit of a nun as a disguise.\n",
      "there a ---- lard continued from time to time to meet her.\n",
      "when fulbert heard of th ----  he put his own interpretation on it.\n",
      "he  ---- lieved that abelard intended to ignore the marriage altogether, and that possibly he might even marry some other woman.\n",
      "in any case, he now hated abelard with all his heart; and he resolved to take a fearful and unnatural vengeance which would at once prevent his enemy from making any other marriage, while at the s ---- e time it would debar him from ecclesiastical preferment.\n",
      "to carry out his plot fulbert first bribed a man who  ----  the body-servant of abelard, watching at the door of his room each night.\n",
      "after abelard had retired and  ----  deep in slumber the treacherous valet unbarred the door.\n",
      "the hirelings of ful ---- rt entered and fell upon the sleeping man.\n",
      "three of them bound him fast, while the fourth, with a razor, inflicted on him the most sh ---- eful mutilation that is possible.\n",
      "then, extinguishing the lights, the wretches slunk away and  ----  lost in darkness, leaving behind their victim bound to his couch, uttering cries of torment and bathed in his own blood.\n",
      "it  ----  a shocking story, and yet it is intensely characteristic of the lawless and barbarous era in which it happened.\n",
      "early the next morning the news flew rapidly through par ---- .\n",
      "the city hummed like a  ---- e-hive.\n",
      "citizens and students and ecclesiastics poured into the street and surrounded the house of a ---- lard.\n",
      "\"almost the entire city,\" says fulques, as quoted by mccabe, \"went cl ---- oring toward his house.\n",
      "unmanned though he  ---- , abelard still retained enough of the spirit of his time to seek vengeance.\n",
      "he, in h ----  turn, employed ruffians whom he set upon the track of those who had assaulted him.\n",
      "the treacherous valet and one of fulbert's hirelings  ----  run down, seized, and mutilated precisely as abelard had been; and their eyes were blinded.\n",
      "a third  ----  lodged in prison.\n",
      "fulbert himself was accused before one of the church courts, which alone had power to punish an ecclesiastic, and all his goods  ----  confiscated.\n",
      "but, meantime, how did it f ----  with heloise?\n",
      "her grief was greater than his own, while her love and her devotion  ----  absolutely undiminished.\n",
      "but abelard now showed a self ---- hness--and indeed, a meanness--far beyond any that he had before exhibited.\n",
      "helo ---- e could no more be his wife.\n",
      "he  ----  unwilling that she should live in the world while he could not; and so he told her sternly that she must take the veil and bury herself for ever in a nunnery.\n",
      "the pain and sh ---- e which she experienced at this came wholly from the fact that evidently abelard did not trust her.\n",
      "it  ----  his distrust that cut her to the heart.\n",
      "still, her love for him  ----  so intense that she obeyed his order.\n",
      "soon after she took the vows; and in the convent chapel, shaken with sobs, she knelt before the altar and assumed the veil of a clo ---- tered nun.\n",
      "abelard himself put on the black tunic of a benedictine monk and entered the abbey of st. den ---- .\n",
      "it  ----  unnecessary here to follow out all the details of the lives of abelard and heloise after this heart-rendering scene.\n",
      "abelard passed through many years of strife and disappointment, and even of humiliation; for on one occasion, just as he had silenced guillaume de ch ---- peaux, so he himself was silenced and put to rout by bernard of clairvaux--\"a frail, tense, absorbed, dominant little man, whose face was white and worn with suffering,\" but in whose eyes there was a light of supreme strength.\n",
      " ---- rnard represented pure faith, as abelard represented pure reason; and the two men met before a great council to match their respective powers.\n",
      "bernard, with fiery eloquence, brought a charge of heresy against abelard in an oration which  ----  like a charge of cavalry.\n",
      "when he had concluded abelard rose with an ashen face, st ---- mered out a few words, and sat down.\n",
      "he was condemned by the council, and his works  ----  ordered to be burned.\n",
      "all his later life  ----  one of misfortune, of humiliation, and even of personal danger.\n",
      "his life  ----  threatened.\n",
      "he betook himself to a desolate and lonely place, where he built for himself a hut of reeds and rushes, hoping to spend h ----  final years in meditation.\n",
      "but there  ----  many who had not forgotten his ability as a teacher.\n",
      "his hut  ----  surrounded by tents and rude hovels, built by his scholars for their shelter.\n",
      "thus abelard resumed his teaching, though in a very different fr ---- e of mind.\n",
      "in time he built a structure of wood and stone, which he called the paraclete, some remains of which can still  ----  seen.\n",
      "all th ----  time no word had passed between him and heloise.\n",
      "but presently abelard wrote and gave to the world a curious and exceedingly frank book, which he called the story of my m ---- fortunes.\n",
      "a copy of it reached the hands of helo ---- e, and she at once sent to abelard the first of a series of letters which have remained unique in the literature of love.\n",
      "ten years had passed, and yet the woman's heart  ----  as faithful and as full of yearning as on the day when the two had parted.\n",
      "it has been said that the letters  ----  not genuine, and they must be read with this assertion in mind; yet it is difficult to believe that any one save heloise herself could have flung a human soul into such frankly passionate utterances, or that any imitator could have done the work.\n",
      "in her first letter, which  ----  sent to abelard written upon parchment, she said: at thy command i would change, not merely my costume, but my very soul, so entirely art thou the sole possessor of my body and my spirit.\n",
      "never, god  ----  my witness, never have i sought anything in thee but thyself; i have sought thee, and not thy gifts.\n",
      "she  ---- gged him to write to her, and to lead her to god, as once he had led her into the mysteries of pleasure.\n",
      "abelard ans ---- d in a letter, friendly to be sure, but formal--the letter of a priest to a cloistered nun.\n",
      "the opening words of it  ----  characteristic of the whole: to heloise, his sister in christ, from abelard, her brother in him.\n",
      "the letter  ----  a long one, but throughout the whole of it the writer's tone was cold and prudent.\n",
      "her second letter bursts forth in a sort of anguish: how hast thou been able to fr ---- e such thoughts, dearest?\n",
      "oh, if i d ---- d but call god cruel to me!\n",
      "oh, most wretched of all creatures that i  ---- !\n",
      "so sweet did i find the pleasures of our loving days that i cannot bring myself to reject them or to ban ---- h them from my memory.\n",
      "wheresoever i go, they thrust themselves upon my v ---- ion, and rekindle the old desire.\n",
      "but abelard knew only too well that not in th ----  life could there be anything save spiritual love between himself and heloise.\n",
      "he wrote to her again and again, always in the s ---- e remote and unimpassioned way.\n",
      "he tells her about the history of monasticism, and discusses with her matters of theology and ethics; but he never writes one word to feed the fl ---- e that is consuming her.\n",
      "the woman understood at last; and by degrees her letters bec ---- e as calm as his--suffused, however, with a tenderness and feeling which showed that in her heart of hearts she was still entirely given to him.\n",
      "after some years abelard left his dwelling at the paraclete, and there was founded there a religious house of which heloise bec ---- e the abbess.\n",
      "all the world respected her for her sweetness, her w ---- dom, and the purity of her character.\n",
      "she made friends as easily as a ---- lard made enemies.\n",
      "even bernard, who had overthrown her husband, sought out helo ---- e to ask for her advice and counsel.\n",
      "abelard died while on his way to rome, whither he  ----  journeying in order to undergo a penalty; and his body was brought back to the paraclete, where it was entombed.\n",
      "over it for twenty-two years heloise watched with tender c ---- ; and when she died, her body was laid beside that of her lover.\n",
      "to-day their bones  ----  mingled as she would have desired them to be mingled.\n",
      "the stones of their tomb in the great cemetery of pere lachaise were brought from the ruins of the paraclete, and above the sarcophagus  ----  two recumbent figures, the whole being the work of the artist alexandra lenoir, who died in 1836. the figure representing heloise is not, however, an authentic likeness.\n",
      "the model for it was a lady belonging to a noble f ---- ily of france, and the figure itself was brought to pere lachaise from the ancient college de beauvais.\n",
      "the letters of helo ---- e have been read and imitated throughout the whole of the last nine centuries.\n",
      "some have found in them the utterances of a woman whose love of love  ----  greater than her love of god and whose intensity of passion nothing could subdue; and so these have condemned her.\n",
      "but others, like chateaubriand, have more truly seen in them a pure and noble spirit to whom fate had been very cruel; and who  ---- , after all, writing to the man who had been her lawful husband.\n",
      "some of the most f ---- ous imitations of her letters are those in the ancient poem entitled, \"the romance of the rose,\" written by jean de meung, in the thirteenth century; and in modern times her first letter was paraphrased by alexander pope, and in french by colardeau.\n",
      "there ex ---- t in english half a dozen translations of them, with abelard's replies.\n",
      "it  ----  interesting to remember that practically all the other writings of abelard remained unpublished and unedited until a very recent period.\n",
      "he was a remarkable figure as a philosopher and scholar; but the world c ---- s for him only because he was loved by heloise.\n",
      "queen elizabeth and the earl of leicester h ---- tory has many romantic stories to tell of the part which women have played in determining the destinies of nations.\n",
      "sometimes it  ----  a woman's beauty that causes the shifting of a province.\n",
      "again it  ----  another woman's rich possessions that incite invasion and lead to bloody wars.\n",
      "marriages or dowries, or the refusal of marriages and the lack of dowries, inheritance through an heiress, the failure of a male succession--in these and in many other ways women have set their mark indelibly upon the trend of h ---- tory.\n",
      "however, if we look over these different events we shall find that it  ----  not so much the mere longing for a woman--the desire to have her as a queen--that has seriously affected the annals of any nation.\n",
      "most royal marriages  ----  made either to secure the succession to a throne by a legitimate line of heirs or else to unite adjoining states and make a powerful kingdom out of two that are less powerful.\n",
      "but, as a rule, kings have found greater delight in some sheltered bower remote from courts than in the castled halls and well-c ---- d-for nooks where their own wives and children have been reared with all the appurtenances of legitimacy.\n",
      "there  ----  not many stories that hang persistently about the love-making of a single woman.\n",
      "in the case of one or another we may find an ep ---- ode or two--something dashing, something spirited or striking, something brilliant and exhilarating, or something sad.\n",
      "but for a woman's whole life to be spent in courtship that meant nothing and that  ----  only a clever aid to diplomacy--this is surely an unusual and really wonderful thing.\n",
      "it is the more unusual because the woman herself  ----  not intended by nature to be wasted upon the cold and cheerless sport of chancellors and counselors and men who had no thought of her except to use her as a pawn.\n",
      "she  ----  hot-blooded, descended from a fiery race, and one whose temper was quick to leap into the passion of a man.\n",
      "in studying th ----  phase of the long and interesting life of elizabeth of england we must notice several important facts.\n",
      "in the first place, she gave herself, above all else, to the maintenance of england--not an england that would be half spanish or half french, or even partly dutch and flemish, but the merry england of tradition--the england that was one and undivided, with its growing freedom of thought, its bows and bills, its nut-brown ale, its sturdy yeomen, and its loyalty to crown and parli ---- ent.\n",
      "and one may really hold that this  ----  true.\n",
      "for england she left herself on record as an arrant liar, false, perjured, yet successful; and because of her success for england's sake her countrymen will hold her in high remembrance, since her scheming and her falsehood  ----  the offenses that one pardons most readily in a woman.\n",
      "in the second place, it must be remembered that elizabeth's courtships and pretended love-makings  ----  almost always a part of her diplomacy.\n",
      "when not a part of her diplomacy they  ----  a mere appendage to her vanity.\n",
      "to seem to be the flower of the english people, and to be surrounded by the noblest, the bravest, and the most handsome cavaliers, not only of her own kingdom, but of others--this  ---- , indeed, a choice morsel of which she was fond of tasting, even though it meant nothing beyond the moment.\n",
      "finally, though at times she could be very cold, and though she made herself still colder in order that she might play fast and loose with foreign suitors who played fast and loose with her--the king of spain, the duc d'alencon, brother of the french king, with an austrian archduke, with a magnificent barbarian prince of muscovy, with eric of sweden, or any other scandinavian suitor--she felt a woman's need for some ne ---- r and more tender association to which she might give freer play and in which she might feel those deeper emotions without the danger that arises when love is mingled with diplomacy.\n",
      "let us first consider a picture of the woman as she really  ----  in order that we may understand her triple nature--consummate mistress of every art that statesmen know, and using at every moment her person as a lure; a vain-glorious queen who seemed to be the prey of boundless vanity; and, lastly, a woman who had all a woman's passion, and who could cast suddenly aside the check and balance which restrained her before the public gaze and could allow herself to give full play to the emotion that she inherited from the king, her father, who was himself a marvel of fire and impetuosity.\n",
      "and anne boleyn should  ----  a gentle, timid maiden would be to make heredity a farce.\n",
      "elizabeth  ----  about twenty-five years of age when she ascended the throne of england.\n",
      "it  ----  odd that the date of her birth cannot be given with precision.\n",
      "the intrigues and disturbances of the english court, and the fact that she  ----  a princess, made her birth a matter of less account than if there had been no male heir to the throne.\n",
      "at any rate, when she ascended it, after the deaths of her brother, king edward vi., and her sister, queen mary, she  ----  a woman well trained both in intellect and in physical development.\n",
      "mr. martin hume, who loves to dwell upon the later years of queen eliza ---- th, speaks rather bitterly of her as a \"painted old harridan\"; and such she may well have seemed when, at nearly seventy years of age, she leered and grinned a sort of skeleton smile at the handsome young courtiers who pretended to see in her the queen of beauty and to be dying for love of her.\n",
      "yet, in her earlier years, when she  ----  young and strong and impetuous, she deserved far different words than these.\n",
      "the portrait of her by zucchero, which now hangs in h ---- pton court, depicts her when she must have been of more than middle age; and still the face is one of beauty, though it be a strange and almost artificial beauty--one that draws, attracts, and, perhaps, lures you on against your will.\n",
      "it is interesting to comp ----  this painting with the frank word-picture of a certain german agent who was sent to england by his emperor, and who seems to have been greatly fascinated by queen elizabeth.\n",
      "she  ----  at that time in the prime of her beauty and her power.\n",
      "her complexion was of that peculiar transp ---- ncy which is seen only in the face of golden blondes.\n",
      "her figure  ----  fine and graceful, and her wit an accomplishment that would have made a woman of any rank or time remarkable.\n",
      "the german envoy says: she lives a life of such magnificence and feasting as can hardly be imagined, and occupies a great portion of her time with balls, banquets, hunting, and similar  ---- usements, with the utmost possible display, but nevertheless she insists upon far greater respect being shown her than was exacted by queen mary.\n",
      "she summons parli ---- ent, but lets them know that her orders must be obeyed in any case.\n",
      "if any one will look at the painting by zucchero he will see how much is made of elizabeth's hands--a distinctive feature quite as noble with the tudors as is the \"hapsburg lip\"  ---- ong the descendants of the house of austria.\n",
      "these  ----  ungloved, and were very long and white, and she looked at them and played with them a great deal; and, indeed, they justified the admiration with which they were regarded by her flatterers.\n",
      "such  ----  the personal appearance of elizabeth.\n",
      "when a young girl, we have still more favorable opinions of her that  ----  written by those who had occasion to be near her.\n",
      "not only do they record swift glimpses of her person, but sometimes in a word or two they give an insight into certain traits of mind which c ---- e out prominently in her later years.\n",
      "it may, perhaps,  ----  well to view her as a woman before we regard her more fully as a queen.\n",
      "it has been said that elizabeth inherited many of the traits of her father--the boldness of spirit, the rapidity of decision, and, at the s ---- e time, the fox-like craft which often showed itself when it was least expected.\n",
      "henry had also, as  ----  well known, a love of the other sex, which has made his reign memorable.\n",
      "and yet it must be noted that while he loved much, it  ----  not loose love.\n",
      "where henry loved, he married; and it  ----  the unfortunate result of these royal marriages that has made him seem unduly fond of women.\n",
      "if, however, we ex ---- ine each one of the separate espousals we shall find that he did not enter into it lightly, and that he broke it off unwillingly.\n",
      "his ardent temper ---- ent, therefore, was checked by a certain rational or conventional propriety, so that he was by no means a loose liver, as many would make him out to be.\n",
      "we must remember this when we recall the charges that have been made against elizabeth, and the strange stories that  ----  told of her tricks--by no means seemly tricks--which she used to play with her guardian, lord thomas seymour.\n",
      "the antics she performed with him in her dressing-room were made the subject of an official inquiry; yet it c ---- e out that while elizabeth was less than sixteen, and lord thomas was very much her senior, his wife was with him on his visits to the chamber of the princess.\n",
      "sir robert tyrwhitt and his wife were also sent to question her, tyrwhitt had a keen mind and one well trained to cope with any other's wit in this sort of cross-ex ---- ination.\n",
      "elizabeth  ----  only a girl of fifteen, yet she was a match for the accomplished courtier in diplomacy and quick retort.\n",
      "he  ----  sent down to worm out of her everything that she knew.\n",
      "threats and flattery and forged letters and false confessions  ----  tried on her; but they were tried in vain.\n",
      "not a comprom ---- ing word could they wring out of her.\n",
      "she bitterly complained of the impr ---- onment of her governess, mrs. ashley, and cried out: \"i have not so behaved that you need put more mistresses upon me!\"\n",
      "altogether, she  ----  too much for sir robert, and he was wise enough to recognize her cleverness.\n",
      "\"she hath a very good wit,\" said he, shrewdly; \"and nothing  ----  to be gotten of her except by great policy.\"\n",
      "mr. hume notes the fact that after the two servants of the princess had been ex ---- ined and had told nothing very serious they found that they had been wise in remaining friends of the royal girl.\n",
      "no sooner had elizabeth become queen than she knighted the man parry and made him treasurer of the household, while mrs. ashley, the governess,  ----  treated with great consideration.\n",
      "even tyrwhitt believed that there  ----  a secret compact between them, for he said, quaintly: \"they all sing one song, and she hath set the note for them.\"\n",
      "soon after th ----  her brother edward's death brought to the throne her elder sister, mary, who has harshly become known as bloody mary.\n",
      "during this time elizabeth put aside her boldness, and bec ---- e apparently a shy and simple-minded virgin.\n",
      "surrounded on every side by those who sought to trap her, there  ----  nothing in her bearing to make her seem the head of a party or the young chief of a faction.\n",
      "she spoke of her s ---- ter in the humblest terms.\n",
      "she exhibited no signs of the tudor animation that  ----  in reality so strong a part of her character.\n",
      "they thought much better of her than they had of her saturnine s ---- ter, the first queen mary.\n",
      "the life of elizabeth has been very oddly m ---- understood, not so much for the facts in it as for the manner in which these have been arranged and the relation which they have to one another.\n",
      "we ought to recollect that this woman did not live in a restricted sphere, that her life  ----  not a short one, and that it was crowded with incidents and full of vivid color.\n",
      "some think of her as living for a short period of time and speak of the great h ---- torical characters who surrounded her as belonging to a single epoch.\n",
      "to them she has one set of suitors all the time--the duc d'alencon, the king of denmark's brother, the prince of sweden, the russian potentate, the archduke sending her sweet messages from austria, the melancholy king of spain, together with a number of her own brilliant englishmen--sir willi ----  pickering, sir robert dudley, lord darnley, the earl of essex, sir philip sidney, and sir walter raleigh.\n",
      "of course, as a matter of fact, elizabeth lived for nearly seventy years--almost three-quarters of a century--and in that long time there c ---- e and went both men and women, those whom she had used and cast aside, with others whom she had also treated with gratitude, and who had died gladly serving her.\n",
      "but through it all there  ----  a continual change in her environment, though not in her.\n",
      "the young soldier went to the battle-field and died; the wise counselor gave her his advice, and she either took it or c ---- d nothing for it.\n",
      "she herself  ----  a curious blending of forwardness and folly, of wisdom and wantonness, of frivolity and unbridled fancy.\n",
      "but through it all she loved her people, even though she often cheated them and made them pay her taxes in the harsh old way that prevailed before there  ----  any right save the king's will.\n",
      "at the s ---- e time, this was only by fits and starts, and on the whole she served them well.\n",
      "therefore, to most of them she  ----  always the good queen bess.\n",
      "what mattered it to the ditcher and yeoman, far from the court, that the queen  ----  said to dance in her nightdress and to swear like a trooper?\n",
      "it was, indeed, largely from these rustic sources that such stories  ----  scattered throughout england.\n",
      "more to the point with them  ----  peace and prosperity throughout the country, the fact that law was administered with honesty and justice, and that england was safe from her deadly enemies--the swarthy spaniards and the scheming french.\n",
      "but, as i said, we must remember always that the elizabeth of one period  ----  not the elizabeth of another, and that the england of one period was not the england of another.\n",
      "as one thinks of it, there  ----  something wonderful in the almost star-like way in which this girl flitted unharmed through a thousand perils.\n",
      "her own countrymen were at first divided against her; a score of greedy, avaricious suitors sought her destruction, or at least her hand to lead her to destruction; all the great powers of the continent were either demanding an alliance with england or threatening to dash england down  ---- id their own dissensions.\n",
      "what had th ----  girl to play off against such dangers?\n",
      "only an undaunted spirit, a scheming mind that knew no scruples, and finally her own person and the fact that she  ----  a woman, and, therefore, might give herself in marriage and become the mother of a race of kings.\n",
      "it  ----  this last weapon, the weapon of her sex, that proved, perhaps, the most powerful of all.\n",
      "by prom ---- ing a marriage or by denying it, or by neither promising nor denying but withholding it, she gave forth a thousand wily intimations which kept those who surrounded her at bay until she had made still another deft and skilful combination, escaping like some startled creature to a new place of safety.\n",
      "in 1583, when she was fifty years of age, she had reached a point when her courtships and her pretended love-making  ----  no longer necessary.\n",
      "she might have sat herself down to rest; for she could feel that her w ---- dom had led her up into a high place, whence she might look down in peace and with assurance of the tranquillity that she had won.\n",
      "not yet had the great armada rolled and thundered toward the engl ---- h shores.\n",
      "but she  ----  certain that her land was secure, compact, and safe.\n",
      "it remains to see what were those  ---- atory relations which she may be said to have sincerely held.\n",
      "she had played at love-making with foreign princes, because it  ----  wise and, for the moment, best.\n",
      "she had played with engl ---- hmen of rank who aspired to her hand, because in that way she might conciliate, at one time her catholic and at another her protestant subjects.\n",
      "but what of the real and inward feeling of her heart, when she  ----  not thinking of political problems or the necessities of state!\n",
      "th ----  is an interesting question.\n",
      "one may at least seek the answer, hoping thereby to solve one of the most interesting phases of th ----  perplexing and most remarkable woman.\n",
      "it must be remembered that it  ----  not a question of whether elizabeth desired marriage.\n",
      "in this sense she may have wished to marry one of the two french princes who were  ---- ong her suitors.\n",
      "but even here she hesitated, and her parli ---- ent disapproved; for by this time england had become largely protestant.\n",
      "again, had she married a french prince and had children, england might have  ---- come an appanage of france.\n",
      "there is no particular evidence that she had any feeling at all for her flemish, austrian, or russian suitors, while the swede's pretensions  ----  the laughing-stock of the english court.\n",
      "so we may set aside th ----  question of marriage as having nothing to do with her emotional life.\n",
      "she did desire a son, as was shown by her passionate outcry when she comp ---- d herself with mary of scotland.\n",
      "\"the queen of scots has a bonny son, while i  ----  but a barren stock!\"\n",
      "she  ----  too wise to wed a subject; though, had she married at all, her choice would doubtless have been an englishman.\n",
      "in this respect, as in so many others, she was like her father, who chose his numerous wives, with the exception of the first, from  ---- ong the english ladies of the court; just as the showy edward iv.\n",
      "was happy in marrying \"d ---- e elizabeth woodville.\"\n",
      "but what a king may do  ----  by no means so easy for a queen; and a husband is almost certain to assume an authority which makes him unpopular with the subjects of his wife.\n",
      "hence, as said above, we must consider not so much whom she would have liked to marry, but rather to whom her love went out spontaneously, and not as a part of that  ---- atory play which amused her from the time when she frisked with seymour down to the very last days, when she could no longer move about, but when she still dabbled her cheeks with rouge and powder and set her skeleton face amid a forest of ruffs.\n",
      "there were many whom she c ---- d for after a fashion.\n",
      "she would not let sir walter raleigh visit her  ---- erican colonies, because she could not bear to have him so long away from her.\n",
      "she had great moments of passion for the earl of essex, though in the end she signed his death-warrant because he  ----  as dominant in spirit as the queen herself.\n",
      "readers of sir walter scott's wonderfully picturesque novel, kenilworth, will note how he throws the strongest light upon eliza ---- th's affection for robert dudley, earl of leicester.\n",
      "scott's h ---- torical instinct is united here with a vein of psychology which goes deeper than is usual with him.\n",
      "we see elizabeth trying hard to sh ----  her favor equally between two nobles; but the earl of essex fails to please her because he lacked those exquisite manners which made leicester so great a favorite with the fastidious queen.\n",
      "then, too, the story of leicester's marriage with  ---- y robsart is something more than a myth, based upon an obscure legend and an ancient ballad.\n",
      "the earl had had such a wife, and there  ----  sinister stories about the manner of her death.\n",
      "but it is scott who invents the villainous varney and the bulldog anthony foster; just as he brought the whole episode into the foreground and made it occur at a period much later than  ----  historically true.\n",
      "still, scott felt--and he  ----  imbued with the spirit and knowledge of that time--a strong conviction that elizabeth loved leicester as she really loved no one else.\n",
      "there  ----  one interesting fact which goes far to convince us.\n",
      "just as her father was, in a way, polyg ---- ous, so elizabeth was even more truly polyandrous.\n",
      "it was inevitable that she should surround herself with attractive men, whose love-locks she would c ---- ss and whose flatteries she would greedily accept.\n",
      "to the outward eye there  ----  very little difference in her treatment of the handsome and daring nobles of her court; yet a historian of her time makes one very shrewd remark when he says: \"to every one she gave some power at times--to all save leicester.\"\n",
      "cecil and walsingh ----  in counsel and essex and raleigh in the field might have their own way at times, and even share the sovereign's power, but to leicester she intrusted no high commands and no important mission.\n",
      "simply because she loved him more than any of the rest; and, knowing th ---- , she knew that if besides her love she granted him any measure of control or power, then she would be but half a queen and would be led either to marry him or else to let him sway her as he would.\n",
      "for the reason given, one may say with confidence that, while elizabeth's light loves  ----  fleeting, she gave a deep affection to this handsome, bold, and brilliant englishman and cherished him in a far different way from any of the others.\n",
      "this was as near as she ever c ---- e to marriage, and it was this love at least which makes shakespeare's famous line as false as it is beautiful, when he describes \"the imperial votaress\" as passing by \"in maiden meditation, fancy free.\"\n",
      "mary queen of scots and lord bothwell mary stuart and cleopatra are the two women who have most attracted the fancy of poets, dr ---- atists, novelists, and painters, from their own time down to the present day.\n",
      "in some respects there is a certain likeness in their c ---- ers.\n",
      "each was queen of a nation whose affairs  ----  entangled with those of a much greater one.\n",
      "each died before her natural life  ----  ended.\n",
      "there  ----  still another parallel which may be found.\n",
      "each of these women  ----  reputed to be exquisitely beautiful; yet each fell short of beauty's highest standards.\n",
      "they  ----  alike remembered in song and story because of qualities that are far more powerful than any physical charm can be.\n",
      "they impressed the imagination of their own contemporaries just as they had impressed the imagination of all succeeding ages, by reason of a strange and irres ---- tible fascination which no one could explain, but which very few could experience and resist.\n",
      "mary stuart  ----  born six days before her father's death, and when the kingdom which was her heritage seemed to be almost in its death-throes.\n",
      "j ---- es v. of scotland, half stuart and half tudor, was no ordinary monarch.\n",
      "he  ----  brave and crafty, keen in statesmanship, and dissolute in pleasure.\n",
      "his first wife had given him no heirs; so at her death he sought out a princess whom he pursued all the more ardently because she  ----  also courted by the burly henry viii.\n",
      "this girl  ----  marie of lorraine, daughter of the duc de guise.\n",
      "she was fit to be the mother of a lion's brood, for she was above six feet in height and of proportions so  ---- ple as to excite the admiration of the royal voluptuary who sat upon the throne of england.\n",
      "\"i  ----  big,\" said he, \"and i want a wife who is as big as i am.\"\n",
      "but j ---- es of scotland wooed in person, and not by embassies, and he triumphantly carried off his strapping princess.\n",
      "henry of england gnawed his beard in vain; and, though in time he found consolation in another woman's arms, he viewed j ---- es not only as a public but as a private enemy.\n",
      "there  ----  war between the two countries.\n",
      "first the scots repelled an english army; but soon they  ----  themselves disgracefully defeated at solway moss by a force much their inferior in numbers.\n",

      "he took little notice of the message; and in a few days he had died, moaning with his last breath the mysterious words: \"it c ---- e with a lass--with a lass it will go!\"\n",
      "the child who was born at this ill-omened crisis was mary stuart, who within a week bec ---- e, in her own right, queen of scotland.\n",
      "henry of england demanded that the infant girl should be betrothed to h ----  young son, prince edward, who afterward reigned as edward vi., though he died while still a boy.\n",
      "the proposal was rejected, and the war between england and scotland went on its bloody course; but meanwhile the little queen was sent to france, her mother's home, so that she might be trained in accomplishments which were r ----  in scotland.\n",
      "in france she grew up at the court of catherine de' medici, that imperious intriguer whose splendid surroundings  ----  tainted with the corruption which she had brought from her native italy.\n",
      "it  ---- , indeed, a singular training-school for a girl of mary stuart's character.\n",
      "poets like ronsard graced the life of the court with exqu ---- ite verse.\n",
      "there were fetes and tourn ---- ents and gallantry of bearing; yet, on the other hand, there was every possible refinement and variety of vice.\n",
      "men  ----  slain before the eyes of the queen herself.\n",
      "the talk of the court  ----  of intrigue and lust and evil things which often verged on crime.\n",
      "catherine de' medici herself kept her nominal husband at arm's-length; and in order to maintain her grasp on france she connived at the corruption of her own children, three of whom  ----  destined in their turn to sit upon the throne.\n",
      "mary stuart grew up in these surroundings until she  ----  sixteen, eating the fruit which gave a knowledge of both good and evil.\n",
      "her intelligence  ----  very great.\n",
      "she  ----  a daring horsewoman.\n",
      "she  ----  a poet and an artist even in her teens.\n",
      "she  ----  also a keen judge of human motives, for those early years of hers had forced her into a womanhood that was premature but wonderful.\n",
      "it had been proposed that she should marry the eldest son of catherine, so that in time the kingdom of scotland and that of france might be united, while if elizabeth of england  ----  to die unmarried her realm also would fall to this pair of children.\n",

      "it never  ----  a marriage in reality.\n",
      "the sickly child would cry all night, for he suffered from abscesses in h ----  ears, and his manhood had been prematurely taken from him.\n",
      "nevertheless, within a twelvemonth the french king died and mary stuart was queen of france as well as of scotland, h ---- pered only by her nominal obedience to the sick boy whom she openly despised.\n",
      "she held her own against the  ---- bitious catherine de' medici, whom she contemptuously nicknamed \"the apothecary's daughter.\"\n",
      "for the brief period of a year she was actually the ruler of france; but then her husband died and she was left a widow, restless,  ---- bitious, and yet no longer having any of the power she loved.\n",

      "she  ----  very tall and very slim, with chestnut hair, \"like a flower of the heat, both lax and delicate.\"\n",
      "her skin was fair and pale, so clear and so transp ---- nt as to make the story plausible that when she drank from a flask of wine, the red liquid could be seen passing down her slender throat.\n",
      "yet with all this she  ----  not fine in texture, but hardy as a man.\n",
      "there was a gle ----  in her hazel eyes that showed her to be brimful of an almost fierce vitality.\n",
      "young as she  ---- , she was the mistress of a thousand arts, and she exhaled a sort of atmosphere that turned the heads of men.\n",

      "she could be subm ---- sive in appearance while still persisting in her aims.\n",
      "she could  ----  languorous and seductive while cold within.\n",
      "again, she could assume the haughtiness which belonged to one who  ----  twice a queen.\n",
      "one  ----  the love of power, and the other was the love of love.\n",
      "the first  ----  natural to a girl who was a sovereign in her own right.\n",
      "the second  ----  inherited, and was then forced into a rank luxuriance by the sort of life that she had seen about her.\n",
      "at eighteen she was a strangely  ---- orous creature, given to fondling and kissing every one about her, with slight discrimination.\n",
      "from her sense of touch she received emotions that  ----  almost necessary to her existence.\n",
      "with her slender, graceful hands she was always stroking the face of some favorite--it might be only the face of a child, or it might be the face of some courtier or poet, or one of the four marys whose n ---- es are linked with hers--mary livingstone, mary fleming, mary beaton, and mary seton, the last of whom remained with her royal mistress until her death.\n",
      "but one must not  ----  too censorious in thinking of mary stuart.\n",
      "she  ----  surrounded everywhere by enemies.\n",
      "during her stay in france she  ----  hated by the faction of catherine de' medici.\n",
      "when she returned to scotland she  ----  hated because of her religion by the protestant lords.\n",
      "her every action  ----  set forth in the worst possible light.\n",
      "the most sinister meaning  ----  given to everything she said or did.\n",
      "she  ----  not a woman to yield herself in love's last surrender unless her intellect and heart alike had been made captive.\n",
      "she would listen to the passionate outpourings of poets and courtiers, and she would plunge her eyes into theirs, and let her hair just touch their faces, and give them her white hands to kiss--but that  ----  all.\n",
      "even in this she was only following the fashion of the court where she was bred, and she was not unlike her royal relative, elizabeth of england, who had the s ---- e external amorousness coupled with the same internal self-control.\n",
      "mary stuart's love life makes a piteous story, for it is the life of one who was ever seeking--seeking for the man to whom she could look up, who could be strong and brave and ardent like herself, and at the s ---- e time be more powerful and more steadfast even than she herself in mind and thought.\n",
      "whatever may be said of her, and howsoever the facts may be colored by partisans, this royal girl, stung though she was by passion and goaded by desire, c ---- d nothing for any man who could not match her in body and mind and spirit all at once.\n",
      "it was in her early widowhood that she first met the man, and when their union c ---- e it brought ruin on them both.\n",
      "in france there c ---- e to her one day one of her own subjects, the earl of bothwell.\n",
      "he  ----  but a few years older than she, and in his presence for the first time she felt, in her own despite, that profoundly moving, indescribable, and never-to-be-forgotten thrill which shakes a woman to the very center of her being, since it is the recognition of a complete affinity.\n",
      "lord bothwell, like queen mary, has  ----  terribly maligned.\n",
      "maurice hewlett has drawn a picture of him more favorable than many, and yet it  ----  a picture that repels.\n",
      "bothwell, says he,  ----  of a type esteemed by those who pronounce vice to be their virtue.\n",
      "he was \"a galliard, flushed with rich blood, broad-shouldered, squ ---- -jawed, with a laugh so happy and so prompt that the world, rejoicing to hear it, thought all must be well wherever he might be.\n",
      "h ----  high color, while it betokened high feeding, got him the credit of good health.\n",
      "his little eyes twinkled so merrily that you did not see they  ----  like a pig's, sly and greedy at once, and bloodshot.\n",
      "h ----  tawny beard concealed a jaw underhung, a chin jutting and dangerous.\n",
      "h ----  mouth had a cruel twist; but his laughing hid that too.\n",
      "the bridge of h ----  nose had been broken; few observed it, or guessed at the brawl which must have given it to him.\n",
      "frankness was his great charm, c ---- less ease in high places.\"\n",
      "and so, when mary stuart first met him in her eighteenth year, lord bothwell made her think as she had never thought of any other man, and as she  ----  not to think of any other man again.\n",
      "she grew to look eagerly for the frank mockery \"in those twinkling eyes, in that quick mouth\"; and to wonder whether it  ----  with him always--asleep, at prayers, fighting, furious, or in love.\n",
      "something more, however, must  ----  said of bothwell.\n",
      "he  ----  undoubtedly a roisterer, but he was very much a man.\n",
      "h ----  sword leaped quickly from its sheath.\n",

      "and yet all the time she  ----  fondling the young pages in her retinue and kissing her maids of honor with her scarlet lips, and lying on their knees, while poets like ronsard and chastelard wrote ardent love sonnets to her and sighed and pined for something more than the privilege of kissing her two dainty hands.\n",
      "in her own realm  ----  fog and rain and only a hut to shelter her upon her landing.\n",
      "when she reached her capital there were few welcoming cheers; but as she rode over the cobblestones to holyrood, the squalid wynds vomited forth great mobs of hard-featured, grim-visaged men and women who st ---- d with curiosity and a half-contempt at the girl queen and her retinue of foreigners.\n",
      "the scots  ----  protestants of the most dour sort, and they distrusted their new ruler because of her religion and because she loved to surround herself with dainty things and bright colors and exotic elegance.\n",

      "it  ----  probably in malmo castle that he died.\n",
      "in 1858 a coffin which  ----  thought to be the coffin of the earl was opened, and a danish artist sketched the head--which corresponds quite well with the other portraits of the ill-fated scottish noble.\n",
      "it  ----  a sad story.\n",
      "had mary been less  ---- bitious when she first met bothwell, or had he been a little bolder, they might have reigned together and lived out their lives in the plenitude of that great love which held them both in thrall.\n",
      "but a queen is not as other women; and she found too late that the teaching of her heart  ---- , after all, the truest teaching.\n",
      "she went to her death as bothwell went to h ---- , alone, in a strange, unfriendly land.\n",
      "yet, even this, perhaps,  ----  better so.\n",

      "queen christina of sweden and the marquis monaldeschi sweden to-day is one of the peaceful kingdoms of the world, whose people  ----  prosperous, well governed, and somewhat apart from the clash and turmoil of other states and nations.\n",
      "even the secession of norway, a few years ago, was accomplished without bloodshed, and now the two kingdoms exist side by side as free from strife as they  ----  with denmark, which once domineered and tyrannized over both.\n",
      "it is difficult to believe that long ago, in the middle ages, the cities of southern sweden were  ---- ong the great commercial centers of the world.\n",
      "stockholm and lund ranked with london and par ---- .\n",
      "they absorbed the commerce of the northern seas, and  ----  the admiration of thousands of travelers and merchants who passed through them and trafficked with them.\n",

      "the  ---- bassadors of the swedish kings were received with the utmost deference in every court.\n",
      " ----  unimportant and isolated in comparison with this northern kingdom, which could pour forth armies of gigantic blond warriors, headed by generals astute as well as brave.\n",
      "it was no small matter, then, in 1626, that the loyal swedes  ----  hoping that their queen would give birth to a male heir to succeed his splendid father, gustavus adolphus, ranked by military historians as one of the six great generals whom the world had so far produced.\n",
      "the expectation  ----  wide-spread and intense that she should now become the mother of a son; and the king himself was no less anxious.\n",
      "when the event occurred, the child  ----  seen to be completely covered with hair, and for this reason the attendants at first believed that it was the desired boy.\n",
      "when their mistake was discovered they  ----  afraid to tell the king, who was waiting in his study for the announcement to be made.\n",
      "at last, when no one else would go to him, h ----  sister, the princess caroline, volunteered to break the news.\n",
      "gustavus  ----  in truth a chivalrous, high-bred monarch.\n",
      "though he must have been d ---- appointed at the advent of a daughter, he showed no sign of dissatisfaction or even of surprise; but, rising, he embraced his sister, saying: \"let us thank god.\n",
      "i hope th ----  girl will be as good as a boy to me.\n",
      "it is customary at almost all courts to pay less attention to the birth of a princess than to that of a prince; but gustavus displayed his chivalry toward this little daughter, whom he n ---- ed christina.\n",
      "he ordered that the full royal salute should be fired in every fortress of h ----  kingdom and that displays of fireworks, balls of honor, and court functions should take place; \"for,\" as he said, \"this is the heir to my throne.\"\n",
      "and so from the first he took his child under his own keeping and treated her as if she  ----  a much-loved son as well as a successor.\n",
      "he joked about her looks when she  ----  born, when she was mistaken for a boy.\n",
      "\"she will  ----  clever,\" he said, \"for she has taken us all in!\"\n",

      "on one occasion the king and the small christina, who  ----  inseparable companions, happened to approach a fortress where they expected to spend the night.\n",
      "the commander of the castle  ----  bound to fire a royal salute of fifty cannon in honor of his sovereign; yet he dreaded the effect upon the princess of such a roaring and bellowing of artillery.\n",
      "he therefore sent a swift horseman to meet the royal party at a d ---- tance and explain his perplexity.\n",
      "gustavus thought for a moment, and then replied: \"my daughter  ----  the daughter of a soldier, and she must learn to lead a soldier's life.\n",
      "let the guns  ----  fired!\"\n",
      "the king looked down at chr ---- tina.\n",
      "her face  ----  aglow with pleasure and excitement; she clapped her hands and laughed, and cried out: \"more bang!\n",
      "this is only one of a score of stories that  ----  circulated about the princess, and the swedes were more and more delighted with the girl who was to be their queen.\n",
      "somewhat curiously, christina's mother, queen maria, cared little for the child, and, in fact, c ---- e at last to detest her almost as much as the king loved her.\n",
      "it  ----  hard to explain this dislike.\n",
      "perhaps she had a morbid desire for a son and  ---- grudged the honors given to a daughter.\n",
      "perhaps she  ----  a little jealous of her own child, who took so much of the king's attention.\n",
      "afterward, in writing of her mother, christina excuses her, and says quite frankly: she could not bear to see me, because i  ----  a girl, and an ugly girl at that.\n",
      "and she  ----  right enough, for i was as tawny as a little turk.\n",
      "th ----  candid description of herself is hardly just.\n",
      "christina  ----  never beautiful, and she had a harsh voice.\n",
      "she  ----  apt to be overbearing even as a little girl.\n",

      "they  ----  admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions.\n",

      "and yet there  ----  but one woman to him, and that woman was the late irene adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\n",
      "my own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in baker street, buried  ---- ong his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature.\n",
      "he  ----  still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.\n",
      "from time to time i heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning f ---- ily of holland.\n",
      "beyond these signs of his activity, however, which i merely sh ---- d with all the readers of the daily press, i knew little of my former friend and companion.\n",
      "one night--it  ----  on the twentieth of march, 1888--i was returning from a journey to a patient (for i had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through baker street.\n",
      "as i passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the study in scarlet, i  ----  seized with a keen desire to see holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.\n",
      "his rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as i looked up, i saw his tall, sp ----  figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind.\n",

      "to me, who knew h ----  every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story.\n",
      "he  ----  at work again.\n",
      "he had risen out of his drug-created dre ---- s and was hot upon the scent of some new problem.\n",
      "i rang the bell and was shown up to the ch ---- ber which had formerly been in part my own.\n",
      "his manner  ----  not effusive.\n",
      "it seldom  ---- ; but he was glad, i think, to see me.\n",
      "with hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across h ----  case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner.\n",
      "then he stood before the fire and looked me over in h ----  singular introspective fashion.\n",
      "i ans ---- d.\n",
      "how do i know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and c ---- less servant girl?\"\n",
      "\"my dear holmes,\" said i, \"th ----  is too much.\n",
      "you would certainly have  ----  burned, had you lived a few centuries ago.\n",
      "it is true that i had a country walk on thursday and c ---- e home in a dreadful mess, but as i have changed my clothes i can't imagine how you deduce it.\n",
      "as to mary jane, she  ----  incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, i fail to see how you work it out.\"\n",
      "he chuckled to himself and rubbed h ----  long, nervous hands together.\n",
      "\"it  ----  simplicity itself,\" said he; \"my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts.\n",
      "obviously they have been caused by someone who has very c ---- lessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.\n",
      "hence, you see, my double deduction that you had  ----  out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the london slavey.\n",
      "as to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon h ----  right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, i must be dull, indeed, if i do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.\"\n",
      "i could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained h ----  process of deduction.\n",
      "\"when i hear you give your reasons,\" i remarked, \"the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that i could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning i  ----  baffled until you explain your process.\n",
      "and yet i believe that my eyes  ----  as good as yours.\"\n",
      "\"quite so,\" he answered, lighting a cig ---- tte, and throwing himself down into an armchair.\n",
      "the d ---- tinction is clear.\n",
      "for ex ---- ple, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.\"\n",
      "\"then how many  ----  there?\"\n",
      "that  ----  just my point.\n",
      "now, i know that there  ----  seventeen steps, because i have both seen and observed.\n",
      "by-the-way, since you  ----  interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\"\n",
      "he threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had  ----  lying open upon the table.\n",
      "\"it c ---- e by the last post,\" said he.\n",
      "the note  ----  undated, and without either signature or address.\n",
      "your recent services to one of the royal houses of europe have shown that you  ----  one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.\n",
      "th ----  account of you we have from all quarters received.\n",
      "be in your ch ---- ber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.\"\n",
      "\"th ----  is indeed a mystery,\" i remarked.\n",
      "it  ----  a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.\n",
      "insensibly one begins to tw ---- t facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.\n",
      "i carefully ex ---- ined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.\n",
      "\"the man who wrote it  ----  presumably well to do,\" i remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes.\n",
      "\"such paper could not  ----  bought under half a crown a packet.\n",
      "it  ----  peculiarly strong and stiff.\"\n",
      "\"peculiar--that  ----  the very word,\" said holmes.\n",
      "\"it  ----  not an english paper at all.\n",
      "\"the n ---- e of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\"\n",
      "the 'g' with the small 't' stands for 'gesellschaft,' which  ----  the german for 'company.'\n",
      "it  ----  a customary contraction like our 'co.'\n",
      "he took down a heavy brown volume from h ----  shelves.\n",
      "\"eglow, eglonitz--here we  ---- , egria.\n",
      "it  ----  in a german-speaking country--in bohemia, not far from carlsbad.\n",
      "'remarkable as  ----  the scene of the death of wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.'\n",
      "his eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cig ---- tte.\n",
      "\"the paper  ----  made in bohemia,\" i said.\n",
      "\"prec ---- ely.\n",
      "and the man who wrote the note  ----  a german.\n",
      "do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence--'th ----  account of you we have from all quarters received.'\n",
      "it  ----  the german who is so uncourteous to his verbs.\n",
      "it only remains, therefore, to d ---- cover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face.\n",
      "and here he comes, if i  ----  not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.\"\n",
      "as he spoke there  ----  the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell.\n",
      "holmes wh ---- tled.\n",
      "\"a nice little brough ----  and a pair of beauties.\n",
      "there's money in th ----  case, watson, if there is nothing else.\"\n",

      "i  ----  lost without my boswell.\n",
      "and th ----  promises to be interesting.\n",
      "it would be a pity to m ---- s it.\"\n",
      "sit down in that armchair, doctor, and give us your  ---- st attention.\"\n",
      "a slow and heavy step, which had  ----  heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door.\n",
      "then there  ----  a loud and authoritative tap.\n",
      "a man entered who could hardly have  ----  less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a hercules.\n",
      "his dress  ----  rich with a richness which would, in england, be looked upon as akin to bad taste.\n",
      "heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with fl ---- e-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl.\n",
      "boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which  ----  trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance.\n",
      "he carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had app ---- ntly adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered.\n",
      "from the lower part of the face he appe ---- d to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.\n",
      "\"th ----  is my friend and colleague, dr. watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases.\n",
      "\"you may address me as the count von kr ---- m, a bohemian nobleman.\n",
      "i understand that th ----  gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom i may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance.\n",

      "\"you may say before th ----  gentleman anything which you may say to me.\"\n",
      "the count shrugged h ----  broad shoulders.\n",
      "\"then i must  ---- gin,\" said he, \"by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance.\n",
      "at present it  ----  not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon european history.\"\n",
      "\"i prom ---- e,\" said holmes.\n",
      "\"you will excuse th ----  mask,\" continued our strange visitor.\n",
      "\"the august person who employs me w ---- hes his agent to be unknown to you, and i may confess at once that the title by which i have just called myself is not exactly my own.\"\n",
      "\"i was aw ----  of it,\" said holmes dryly.\n",
      "\"the circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning f ---- ilies of europe.\n",
      "\"i was also aw ----  of that,\" murmured holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.\n",
      "our visitor glanced with some app ---- nt surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe.\n",
      "holmes slowly reopened h ----  eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\n",
      "\"if your majesty would condescend to state your case,\" he remarked, \"i should be better able to adv ---- e you.\"\n",
      "the man sprang from h ----  chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation.\n",

      "\"you are right,\" he cried; \"i  ----  the king.\n",
      "\"your majesty had not spoken before i was aw ----  that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich sigismond von ormstein, grand duke of cassel-felstein, and hereditary king of bohemia.\"\n",
      "\"but you can understand,\" said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, \"you can understand that i  ----  not accustomed to doing such business in my own person.\n",
      "yet the matter  ----  so delicate that i could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power.\n",
      "\"then, pray consult,\" said holmes, shutting h ----  eyes once more.\n",
      "\"the facts  ----  briefly these: some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to warsaw, i made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, irene adler.\n",
      "the n ---- e is no doubt familiar to you.\"\n",
      "\"kindly look her up in my index, doctor,\" murmured holmes without opening h ----  eyes.\n",
      "for many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to n ---- e a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information.\n",
      "in th ----  case i found her biography sandwiched in between that of a hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\n",
      "your majesty, as i understand, bec ---- e entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.\"\n",

      "slipping through the shouting crowd i made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes  ----  rejoiced to find my friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar.\n",

      "\"i know, my dear watson, that you sh ----  my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life.\n",

      "\"your cases have indeed  ----  of the greatest interest to me,\" i observed.\n",
      "\"you will remember that i remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by m ---- s mary sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.\"\n",

      "now, mr. jabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me th ----  morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which i have listened to for some time.\n",
      "you have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things  ----  very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed.\n",
      "as far as i have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly  ---- ong the most singular that i have ever listened to.\n",
      "i ask you not merely  ---- cause my friend dr. watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips.\n",
      "as a rule, when i have heard some slight indication of the course of events, i  ----  able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory.\n",
      "in the present instance i  ----  forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.\"\n",
      "the portly client puffed out h ----  chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat.\n",
      "as he glanced down the advert ---- ement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, i took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.\n",
      "our v ---- itor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow.\n",
      "he wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an orn ---- ent.\n",
      "a frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair  ---- side him.\n",
      "altogether, look as i would, there  ----  nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.\n",
      "sherlock holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook h ----  head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances.\n",
      "\"beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a freemason, that he has been in china, and that he has done a considerable  ---- ount of writing lately, i can deduce nothing else.\"\n",
      "mr. jabez wilson started up in h ----  chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.\n",
      "\"how, in the n ---- e of good-fortune, did you know all that, mr.\n",
      "\"how did you know, for ex ---- ple, that i did manual labour.\n",
      "it's as true as gospel, for i  ---- gan as a ship's carpenter.\"\n",

      "mr. ja ---- z wilson laughed heavily.\n",

      "\"what on earth does th ----  mean?\"\n",

      "\"well, it is just as i have been telling you, mr. sherlock holmes,\" said jabez wilson, mopping his forehead; \"i have a small pawnbroker's business at coburg squ ---- , near the city.\n",

      "\"he  ----  still with you, i presume?\"\n",

      "\"'why, what  ----  it, then?'\n",
      "you see, mr. holmes, i  ----  a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, i was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat.\n",
      "in that way i didn't know much of what  ----  going on outside, and i was always glad of a bit of news.\n",

      "\"'and what  ----  they worth?'\n",
      "\"'oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work  ----  slight, and it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations.'\n",
      "\"well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not  ----  over-good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.\n",
      "\"'well,' said he, showing me the advert ---- ement, 'you can see for yourself that the league has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars.\n",
      "as far as i can make out, the league was founded by an  ---- erican millionaire, ezekiah hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways.\n",
      "he  ----  himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour.\n",
      "from all i hear it  ----  splendid pay and very little to do.'\n",

      "'you see it  ----  really confined to londoners, and to grown men.\n",
      "this  ---- erican had started from london when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn.\n",
      "then, again, i have heard it  ----  no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red.\n",
      "now, if you c ---- d to apply, mr. wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.'\n",
      "\"now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there  ----  to be any competition in the matter i stood as good a chance as any man that i had ever met.\n",
      "he  ----  very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.\n",
      "from north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tr ---- ped into the city to answer the advertisement.\n",
      "fleet street  ----  choked with red-headed folk, and pope's court looked like a coster's orange barrow.\n",
      "i should not have thought there  ----  so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement.\n",
      "every shade of colour they were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid fl ---- e-coloured tint.\n",
      "when i saw how many  ----  waiting, i would have given it up in despair; but spaulding would not hear of it.\n",
      "there was a double stre ----  upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.\"\n",
      "\"your experience has been a most entertaining one,\" remarked holmes as h ----  client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.\n",
      "\"there  ----  nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine.\n",
      "he said a few words to each candidate as he c ---- e up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them.\n",
      "getting a vacancy did not seem to  ----  such a very easy matter, after all.\n",
      "however, when our turn c ---- e the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.\n",
      "\"'th ----  is mr. jabez wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the league.'\n",
      "\"'and he is admirably suited for it,' the other ans ---- d.\n",
      "he took a step backward, cocked h ----  head on one side, and gazed at my hair until i felt quite bashful.\n",
      "\"'it would  ----  injustice to hesitate,' said he.\n",
      "'you will, however, i  ----  sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.'\n",
      "with that he seized my hair in both h ----  hands, and tugged until i yelled with the pain.\n",
      "'there  ----  water in your eyes,' said he as he released me.\n",
      "'i perceive that all  ----  as it should be.\n",
      "but we have to be c ---- ful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint.\n",
      "i could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which would d ---- gust you with human nature.'\n",
      "he stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy  ----  filled.\n",
      "a groan of disappointment c ---- e up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\n",
      "\"'my n ---- e,' said he, 'is mr. duncan ross, and i am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor.\n",

      "\"my face lengthened at this, mr. holmes, for i thought that i  ----  not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.\n",

      "when shall you  ----  able to enter upon your new duties?'\n",
      "\"'well, it  ----  a little awkward, for i have a business already,' said i.\n",

      "\"well, i thought over the matter all day, and by evening i  ----  in low spirits again; for i had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be i could not imagine.\n",

      "the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired saxe-coburg squ ----  presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back.\n",
      "it  ----  one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the city to the north and west.\n",
      "the roadway was blocked with the immense stre ----  of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians.\n",
      "it was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant squ ----  which we had just quitted.\n",
      "\"let me see,\" said holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, \"i should like just to remem ---- r the order of the houses here.\n",

      "there  ----  mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the coburg branch of the city and suburban bank, the vegetarian restaurant, and mcfarlane's carriage-building depot.\n",

      "my friend  ----  an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit.\n",
      "all the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dre ---- y eyes were as unlike those of holmes the sleuth-hound, holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive.\n",
      "in h ----  singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as i have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him.\n",
      "the swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as i knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair  ---- id his improvisations and his black-letter editions.\n",
      "then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who  ----  unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals.\n",
      "when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st. j ---- es's hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.\n",

      "i trust that i  ----  not more dense than my neighbours, but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes.\n",
      "here i had heard what he had heard, i had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it  ----  evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque.\n",
      "as i drove home to my house in kensington i thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the \"encyclopaedia\" down to the visit to saxe-coburg squ ---- , and the ominous words with which he had parted from me.\n",
      "what  ----  this nocturnal expedition, and why should i go armed?\n",

      "two hansoms  ----  standing at the door, and as i entered the passage i heard the sound of voices from above.\n",
      "on entering his room i found holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom i recognised as peter jones, the official police agent, while the other  ----  a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.\n",
      "our party  ----  complete,\" said holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack.\n",

      "all he wants  ----  an old dog to help him to do the running down.\"\n",
      "\"i hope a wild goose may not prove to  ----  the end of our chase,\" observed mr. merryweather gloomily.\n",
      "\"he has his own little methods, which  ---- , if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him.\n",
      "it  ----  not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the sholto murder and the agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force.\"\n",
      "\"oh, if you say so, mr. jones, it  ----  all right,\" said the stranger with deference.\n",

      "for you, mr. merryweather, the stake will be some 30,000 pounds; and for you, jones, it will be the man upon whom you w ---- h to lay your hands.\"\n",

      "he'll crack a crib in scotland one week, and be ra ---- ing money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next.\n",
      "i've been on h ----  track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.\"\n",
      "i've had one or two little turns also with mr. john clay, and i agree with you that he  ----  at the head of his profession.\n",
      "it  ----  past ten, however, and quite time that we started.\n",
      "sherlock holmes  ----  not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon.\n",

      "we had reached the s ---- e crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning.\n",
      "our cabs  ----  dismissed, and, following the guidance of mr. merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us.\n",
      "within there  ----  a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate.\n",
      "this also  ----  opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate.\n",
      "mr. merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which  ----  piled all round with crates and massive boxes.\n",

      "holmes stuck h ----  feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\n",
      "it  ----  a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference.\n",
      "it  ----  worth an effort to preserve it.\n",

      "she bec ---- e restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball.\n",
      "he conceives an idea more creditable to h ----  head than to his heart.\n",
      "with the connivance and ass ---- tance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl's short sight, he appears as mr. hosmer angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself.\"\n",

      "\"we never thought that she would have  ----  so carried away.\"\n",
      "however that may be, the young lady  ----  very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in france, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind.\n",

      "then mr. angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect  ----  to be produced.\n",
      "there  ----  meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl's affections from turning towards anyone else.\n",
      "but the deception could not  ----  kept up forever.\n",
      "these pretended journeys to france  ----  rather cumbrous.\n",
      "the thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dr ---- atic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come.\n",
      "hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a test ---- ent, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding.\n",
      "j ---- es windibank wished miss sutherland to be so bound to hosmer angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man.\n",

      "the case has, in some respects,  ----  not entirely devoid of interest.\"\n",
      "\"well, of course it  ----  obvious from the first that this mr. hosmer angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather.\n",
      "then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appe ---- d when the other was away, was suggestive.\n",
      "so  ----  the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers.\n",

      "everybody about here speaks of h ----  kindness to him.\"\n",
      "does it not strike you as a little singular that this mccarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to turner, should still talk of marrying his son to turner's daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it  ----  merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow?\n",
      "it is the more strange, since we know that turner himself  ----  averse to the idea.\n",
      "\"you  ----  right,\" said holmes demurely; \"you do find it very hard to tackle the facts.\"\n",

      "his face  ----  bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck.\n",
      "his nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind  ----  so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply.\n",
      "swiftly and silently he made h ----  way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the boscombe pool.\n",
      "it was d ---- p, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side.\n",
      "lestrade and i walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while i watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions  ----  directed towards a definite end.\n",
      "the boscombe pool, which  ----  a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the hatherley farm and the private park of the wealthy mr. turner.\n",

      "to holmes, as i could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the tr ---- pled grass.\n",
      "he ran round, like a dog who  ----  picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.\n",

      "\"these  ----  young mccarthy's feet.\n",
      "twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles  ----  deeply marked and the heels hardly visible.\n",
      "that bears out h ----  story.\n",
      "he ran when he saw h ----  father on the ground.\n",
      "then here  ----  the father's feet as he paced up and down.\n",

      "holmes traced h ----  way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction.\n",
      "for a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and ex ---- ining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach.\n",

      "when these hot fits  ----  over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul.\n",

      "its outrages  ----  usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others.\n",
      "on receiving th ----  the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country.\n",
      "so perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages  ----  traced home to the perpetrators.\n",
      "for some years the organ ---- ation flourished in spite of the efforts of the united states government and of the better classes of the community in the south.\n",
      "eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the s ---- e sort since that date.'\n",
      "\"you will observe,\" said holmes, laying down the volume, \"that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of openshaw from  ---- erica with their papers.\n",

      "it is no wonder that he and his f ---- ily have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track.\n",

      "the alarm, however,  ----  given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered.\n",
      "it proved to be that of a young gentleman whose n ---- e, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was john openshaw, and whose residence is near horsham.\n",
      "it is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from waterloo station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river ste ---- boats.\n",
      "the body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had  ----  the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages.\"\n",

      "at the farther end  ----  a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.\n",
      "as i entered, a sallow malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug,  ---- ckoning me to an empty berth.\n",
      "\"there  ----  a friend of mine here, mr. isa whitney, and i wish to speak with him.\"\n",
      "there was a movement and an excl ---- ation from my right, and peering through the gloom, i saw whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.\n",

      "they could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between h ----  knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers.\n",
      "it took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of aston ---- hment.\n",
      "he had turned his back so that none could see him but i. his form had filled out, his wrinkles  ----  gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than sherlock holmes.\n",
      "he made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned h ----  face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.\n",

      "\"as low as you can,\" he ans ---- d; \"i have excellent ears.\n",

      "sherlock holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data  ----  insufficient.\n",
      "it  ----  soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting.\n",

      "when an actor i had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been f ---- ous in the green-room for my skill.\n",
      "i painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible i made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a tw ---- t by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster.\n",

      "\"well, you can imagine how hard it  ----  to settle down to arduous work at 2 pounds a week when i knew that i could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still.\n",
      "it  ----  a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and i threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which i had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers.\n",
      "he was the keeper of a low den in which i used to lodge in swand ----  lane, where i could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town.\n",

      "i do not mean that any beggar in the streets of london could earn 700 pounds a year--which  ----  less than my average takings--but i had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the city.\n",
      "all day a stre ----  of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which i failed to take 2 pounds.\n",

      "but then it occurred to me that there might  ----  a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me.\n",

      "a large face, se ---- d with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.\n",
      "\"which of you  ----  holmes?\"\n",
      "asked th ----  apparition.\n",

      "scre ---- ed the old man furiously.\n",
      "\"but i have heard that the crocuses prom ---- e well,\" continued my companion imperturbably.\n",

      "h ----  smile broadened.\n",

      "don't you d ----  to meddle with my affairs.\n",
      "i know that m ---- s stoner has been here.\n",
      "i  ----  a dangerous man to fall foul of!\n",
      "he stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with h ----  huge brown hands.\n",
      "\"see that you keep yourself out of my grip,\" he snarled, and hurling the tw ---- ted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\n",
      "\"he seems a very  ---- iable person,\" said holmes, laughing.\n",
      "\"i  ----  not quite so bulky, but if he had remained i might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.\"\n",
      "\"fancy h ----  having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force!\n",
      "th ----  incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and i only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her.\n",
      "and now, watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards i shall walk down to doctors' commons, where i hope to get some data which may help us in th ----  matter.\"\n",
      "it  ----  nearly one o'clock when sherlock holmes returned from his excursion.\n",
      "he held in h ----  hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.\n",
      "\"to determine its exact meaning i have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it  ----  concerned.\n",
      "the total income, which at the time of the wife's death  ----  little short of 1100 pounds, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than 750 pounds.\n",
      "it  ----  evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent.\n",
      "my morning's work has not been  ---- ted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort.\n",
      "and now, watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aw ----  that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to waterloo.\n",
      "i should  ----  very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket.\n",
      "2  ----  an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots.\n",
      "that and a tooth-brush  ---- , i think, all that we need.\"\n",
      "at waterloo we  ----  fortunate in catching a train for leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes.\n",
      "it  ----  a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens.\n",
      "the trees and wayside hedges  ----  just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth.\n",
      "to me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we  ----  engaged.\n",
      "my companion sat in the front of the trap, h ----  arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought.\n",
      "a heavily tim ---- red park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point.\n",
      "from  ---- id the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\n",
      "\"yes, sir, that  ----  the house of dr. grimesby roylott,\" remarked the driver.\n",
      "\"there is some building going on there,\" said holmes; \"that is where we  ----  going.\"\n",
      "\"there's the village,\" said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some d ---- tance to the left; \"but if you want to get to the house, you'll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over the fields.\n",
      "there it  ---- , where the lady is walking.\"\n",
      "\"and the lady, i fancy,  ----  miss stoner,\" observed holmes, shading his eyes.\n",
      "\"yes, i think we had  ---- tter do as you suggest.\"\n",
      "we got off, paid our f ---- , and the trap rattled back on its way to leatherhead.\n",
      "\"i thought it as well,\" said holmes as we climbed the stile, \"that th ----  fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business.\n",
      "it may stop h ----  gossip.\n",
      "good-afternoon, m ---- s stoner.\n",
      "you see that we have  ----  as good as our word.\"\n",
      "\"i have  ----  waiting so eagerly for you,\" she cried, shaking hands with us warmly.\n",
      "dr. roylott has gone to town, and it  ----  unlikely that he will be back before evening.\"\n",
      "m ---- s stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\n",
      "\"he is so cunning that i never know when i  ----  safe from him.\n",
      "\"he must guard himself, for he may find that there  ----  someone more cunning than himself upon his track.\n",
      "if he  ----  violent, we shall take you away to your aunt's at harrow.\n",
      "now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to ex ---- ine.\"\n",
      "the building  ----  of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side.\n",
      "in one of these wings the windows  ----  broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin.\n",
      "the central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the f ---- ily resided.\n",
      "some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there  ----  no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit.\n",
      "holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and ex ---- ined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.\n",
      "\"this, i take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister's, and the one next to the main building to dr. roylott's ch ---- ber?\"\n",
      "but i  ----  now sleeping in the middle one.\"\n",
      "by the way, there does not seem to  ----  any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.\"\n",
      "\"there  ----  none.\n",
      "i believe that it  ----  an excuse to move me from my room.\"\n",
      "that  ----  suggestive.\n",
      "now, on the other side of th ----  narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open.\n",
      "there  ----  windows in it, of course?\"\n",
      "\"as you both locked your doors at night, your rooms  ----  unapproachable from that side.\n",
      "miss stoner did so, and holmes, after a careful ex ---- ination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without success.\n",
      "there  ----  no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar.\n",
      "then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they  ----  of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry.\n",
      "said he, scratching h ----  chin in some perplexity, \"my theory certainly presents some difficulties.\n",
      "no one could pass these shutters if they  ----  bolted.\n",
      "a small side door led into the white ---- hed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened.\n",
      "holmes refused to ex ---- ine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which miss stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate.\n",
      "it  ----  a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses.\n",
      "a brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned  ---- d in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window.\n",
      "these articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a squ ----  of wilton carpet in the centre.\n",
      "the boards round and the panelling of the walls  ----  of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house.\n",
      "holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while h ----  eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.\n",
      "\"where does that  ---- ll communicate with?\"\n",
      "he asked at last pointing to a thick  ---- ll-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.\n",
      "\"yes, it  ----  only put there a couple of years ago.\"\n",
      "\"your s ---- ter asked for it, i suppose?\"\n",
      "\"indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a  ---- ll-pull there.\n",
      "you will excuse me for a few minutes while i sat ---- fy myself as to this floor.\"\n",
      "he threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, ex ---- ining minutely the cracks between the boards.\n",
      "then he did the s ---- e with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled.\n",
      "finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running h ----  eye up and down the wall.\n",
      "finally he took the bell-rope in h ----  hand and gave it a brisk tug.\n",
      "\"no, it  ----  not even attached to a wire.\n",
      "th ----  is very interesting.\n",
      "you can see now that it  ----  fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is.\"\n",
      "i never noticed that  ---- fore.\"\n",
      "\"there  ----  one or two very singular points about this room.\n",
      "for ex ---- ple, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!\"\n",

      "\"yes, there  ----  several little changes carried out about that time.\"\n",

      "with your perm ---- sion, miss stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment.\"\n",
      "dr. grimesby roylott's ch ---- ber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished.\n",
      "a c ---- p-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.\n",

      "\"yes, but i do not think that it  ----  such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms.\n",
      "it  ----  so small that a rat could hardly pass through.\"\n",

      "it could only be a small one, or it would have  ----  remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry.\n",
      "\"but what harm can there  ----  in that?\"\n",
      "\"well, there  ----  at least a curious coincidence of dates.\n",
      "a ventilator  ----  made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies.\n",
      "\"did you observe anything very peculiar about that  ---- d?\"\n",
      "\"it was cl ---- ped to the floor.\n",
      "did you ever see a  ---- d fastened like that before?\"\n",
      "\"the lady could not move her  ---- d.\n",
      "it must always be in the s ---- e relative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.\"\n",
      "\"holmes,\" i cried, \"i seem to see dimly what you  ----  hinting at.\n",
      "we  ----  only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.\"\n",
      "when a doctor does go wrong he  ----  the first of criminals.\n",
      "palmer and pritchard were  ---- ong the heads of their profession.\n",
      "th ----  man strikes even deeper, but i think, watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still.\n",
      "but we shall have horrors enough before the night  ----  over; for goodness' sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful.\"\n",
      "about nine o'clock the light  ---- ong the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the manor house.\n",
      "\"that  ----  our signal,\" said holmes, springing to his feet; \"it comes from the middle window.\"\n",
      "as we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we  ----  going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there.\n",
      "a moment later we  ----  out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.\n",
      "there  ----  little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall.\n",
      "making our way  ---- ong the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.\n",
      "i wh ---- pered; \"did you see it?\"\n",
      "holmes  ----  for the moment as startled as i. his hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation.\n",
      "then he broke into a low laugh and put h ----  lips to my ear.\n",
      "\"it  ----  a nice household,\" he murmured.\n",
      "\"that  ----  the baboon.\"\n",
      "there  ----  a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment.\n",
      "i confess that i felt easier in my mind when, after following holmes' ex ---- ple and slipping off my shoes, i found myself inside the bedroom.\n",
      "my companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the l ---- p onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room.\n",
      "all  ----  as we had seen it in the daytime.\n",
      "then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it  ----  all that i could do to distinguish the words: \"the least sound would be fatal to our plans.\"\n",
      "have your p ---- tol ready in case we should need it.\n",
      "i will sit on the side of the  ---- d, and you in that chair.\"\n",
      "holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and th ----  he placed upon the bed beside him.\n",
      "then he turned down the l ---- p, and we were left in darkness.\n",
      "i could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet i knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the s ---- e state of nervous tension in which i was myself.\n",
      "from outside c ---- e the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty.\n",
      "far away we could hear the deep tones of the par ---- h clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour.\n",
      "twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might  ---- fall.\n",
      "suddenly there was the momentary gle ----  of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.\n",
      "i heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all  ----  silent once more, though the smell grew stronger.\n",
      "then suddenly another sound bec ---- e audible--a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle.\n",
      "the instant that we heard it, holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with h ----  cane at the bell-pull.\n",
      "at the moment when holmes struck the light i heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden gl ----  flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely.\n",
      "i could, however, see that his face  ----  deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing.\n",
      "he had ceased to strike and  ----  gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened.\n",
      "they say that away down in the village, and even in the d ---- tant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds.\n",
      "\"it means that it is all over,\" holmes ans ---- d.\n",
      "\"and perhaps, after all, it  ----  for the best.\n",
      "take your p ---- tol, and we will enter dr. roylott's room.\"\n",
      "with a grave face he lit the l ---- p and led the way down the corridor.\n",
      "twice he struck at the ch ---- ber door without any reply from within.\n",
      "then he turned the handle and entered, i at h ----  heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.\n",
      "it  ----  a singular sight which met our eyes.\n",
      "on the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant be ----  of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar.\n",
      "beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat dr. grimesby roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his b ----  ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless turkish slippers.\n",
      "across h ----  lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day.\n",
      "his chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid st ----  at the corner of the ceiling.\n",
      "round h ----  brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head.\n",
      "wh ---- pered holmes.\n",
      "in an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from  ---- ong his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\n",
      "\"it is a sw ---- p adder!\"\n",
      "he has died within ten seconds of  ----  bitten.\n",
      "let us thrust th ----  creature back into its den, and we can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened.\"\n",
      "such  ----  the true facts of the death of dr. grimesby roylott, of stoke moran.\n",
      "it is not necessary that i should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry c ---- e to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet.\n",
      "the little which i had yet to learn of the case  ----  told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back next day.\n",
      "\"i had,\" said he, \"come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear watson, how dangerous it always  ----  to reason from insufficient data.\n",
      "the presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word 'band,' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match,  ----  sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent.\n",
      "i can only claim the merit that i instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it bec ---- e clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door.\n",
      "my attention  ----  speedily drawn, as i have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed.\n",
      "the discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was cl ---- ped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed.\n",
      "the idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when i coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor  ----  furnished with a supply of creatures from india, i felt that i was probably on the right track.\n",
      "the idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test  ----  just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an eastern training.\n",
      "the rapidity with which such a po ---- on would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage.\n",
      "it would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could d ---- tinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work.\n",
      "then i thought of the wh ---- tle.\n",
      "of course he must recall the snake  ---- fore the morning light revealed it to the victim.\n",
      "he would put it through th ----  ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed.\n",
      "\"i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered h ----  room.\n",
      "an inspection of h ----  chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator.\n",
      "the sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord  ----  enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained.\n",
      "the metallic clang heard by miss stoner  ----  obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant.\n",
      "i heard the creature h ---- s as i have no doubt that you did also, and i instantly lit the light and attacked it.\"\n",
      "some of the blows of my cane c ---- e home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw.\n",
      "in this way i  ----  no doubt indirectly responsible for dr. grimesby roylott's death, and i cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience.\"\n",
      "the adventure of the engineer's thumb of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, mr. sherlock holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there  ----  only two which i was the means of introducing to his notice--that of mr. hatherley's thumb, and that of colonel warburton's madness.\n",
      "of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dr ---- atic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results.\n",
      "the story has, i believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect  ----  much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth.\n",
      "it was in the summer of '89, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which i  ----  now about to summarise.\n",
      "i had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned holmes in h ----  baker street rooms, although i continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us.\n",
      "my practice had steadily increased, and as i happened to live at no very great distance from paddington station, i got a few patients from  ---- ong the officials.\n",
      "one of these, whom i had cured of a painful and lingering disease,  ----  never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.\n",
      "one morning, at a little before seven o'clock, i was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from paddington and  ----  waiting in the consulting-room.\n",
      "i dressed hurriedly, for i knew by experience that railway cases  ----  seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs.\n",
      "as i descended, my old ally, the guard, c ---- e out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.\n",
      "\"i've got him here,\" he wh ---- pered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; \"he's all right.\"\n",
      "\"what  ----  it, then?\"\n",
      "i asked, for his manner suggested that it  ----  some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.\n",
      "\"it's a new patient,\" he wh ---- pered.\n",
      "there he  ---- , all safe and sound.\n",
      "i must go now, doctor; i have my dooties, just the s ---- e as you.\"\n",
      "and off he went, th ----  trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.\n",
      "he  ----  quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books.\n",
      "round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which  ----  mottled all over with bloodstains.\n",
      "he  ----  young, not more than five-and-twenty, i should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.\n",
      "\"i  ----  sorry to knock you up so early, doctor,\" said he, \"but i have had a very serious accident during the night.\n",
      "i c ---- e in by train this morning, and on inquiring at paddington as to where i might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here.\n",
      "that was the n ---- e, style, and abode of my morning visitor.\n",
      "\"you  ----  fresh from a night journey, i understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation.\"\n",
      "\"oh, my night could not  ----  called monotonous,\" said he, and laughed.\n",
      "he laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in h ----  chair and shaking his sides.\n",
      "it  ----  useless, however.\n",
      "he  ----  off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone.\n",
      "presently he c ---- e to himself once more, very weary and pale-looking.\n",
      "\"i have  ----  making a fool of myself,\" he gasped.\n",
      "drink th ---- .\"\n",
      "i dashed some brandy into the water, and the colour began to come back to h ----  bloodless cheeks.\n",
